## Top Priority Additions

### 1. **Tre Tucker, WR - Las Vegas Raiders**
**Drop:** Rico Dowdle, RB - Carolina Panthers
- **Current Stats:** 222 yards, 4 TDs through 3 weeks
- **Week 3 Performance:** 40.9 PPR points
- **Target Share:** 17 targets over past 2 weeks
- **Role:** Clear WR2 in Vegas offense
- **Why Drop Dowdle:** Stuck in committee, only 30 yards on 10 carries Week 3, projecting 3.4 PPR points weekly

### 2. **Quentin Johnston, WR - Los Angeles Chargers**
**Drop:** Tyler Allgeier, RB - Atlanta Falcons
- **Current Stats:** 237 yards, 3 TDs
- **Average:** 79 yards per game
- **Rankings:** Top 20 WR rest-of-season
- **Role:** Emerging as legitimate WR2
- **Why Drop Allgeier:** Buried behind Bijan Robinson, projecting only 4.0 PPR points weekly

### 3. **Hunter Henry, TE - New England Patriots**
**Drop:** Mac Jones, QB - San Francisco 49ers
- **Recent Performance:** 29 PPR points vs Pittsburgh
- **Current Stats:** 165 yards, 2 TDs
- **Rankings:** TE16, pushing into TE1 territory
- **Why Drop Jones:** 4th QB on roster (behind Richardson, Fields, McCarthy), adds zero value

### 4. **Elic Ayomanor, WR - Tennessee Titans**
**Drop:** Patriots Defense
- **Target Share:** 21.3% of Tennessee's offense
- **Current Stats:** 107 yards, 2 TDs
- **Week 2 Finish:** WR24
- **Expert Consensus:** #1 WR waiver target for Week 4
- **Why Drop Patriots D:** Already have Eagles DST (superior option)

### 5. **Emari Demercado, RB - Arizona Cardinals**
**Drop:** Blake Grupe, K - New Orleans Saints
- **Role:** Direct handcuff to Trey Benson with Conner out
- **Offense:** High-powered Cardinals attack
- **Insurance Value:** Critical RB depth
- **Why Drop Grupe:** Will Reichard (6/6 FG, 7/7 XP) is superior

## Bonus High-Risk/High-Reward Option

### **DeAndre Hopkins, WR - Baltimore Ravens**
**Consider Dropping:** Wan'Dale Robinson or similar lower-end WR
- **Current Production:** 49.5 yards/game, 2 TDs
- **Usage:** Only 32.7% route participation, 8.3% target share
- **Upside:** Could explode if Ravens increase involvement
- **Risk:** May remain limited in run-heavy offense

## Summary Impact

**Roster Transformation:**
- **OUT:** 2 underperforming RBs, 1 redundant QB, 1 redundant K, 1 redundant DEF
- **IN:** 3 explosive WRs, 1 TE1 candidate, 1 RB handcuff insurance

**Projected Weekly Points:**
- **Players Dropped:** ~20-25 combined PPR points
- **Players Added:** ~75-100 combined PPR points potential

**Net Gain:** +50-75 PPR points weekly potential

## Action Priority
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Tucker and Johnston before other owners notice
2. **HIGH:** Henry for TE depth/flex potential
3. **MODERATE:** Ayomanor and Demercado for upside/insurance
4. **OPTIONAL:** Hopkins if feeling aggressive
