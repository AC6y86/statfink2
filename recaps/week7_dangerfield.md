# Week 7 Recap: No Respect Fantasy League
## *tugs collar* "I Tell Ya, This League Don't Give Me No Respect!"

Boy, I tell ya, Week 7 in this fantasy league was tougher than my childhood. And that's saying something - when I was a kid, my parents moved a lot... but I always found them! *loosens tie* But seriously folks, this week had more ups and downs than my blood pressure at an all-you-can-eat buffet. 

I mean, what a week! Some teams scored so high they needed oxygen masks, while others scored so low they needed life support. The scores were more lopsided than my first marriage - and let me tell you, that woman was so far to one side, she made the Leaning Tower of Pisa look straight! *tugs collar*

The league standings are shakier than my hands after my fifth martini. We got Mike's Team sitting pretty at the top with 134 points - the guy's so hot right now, his roster should come with a fire extinguisher. Meanwhile, poor Mitch down at the bottom with 59.5 points - I haven't seen anyone get beat that bad since... well, since every time I look in the mirror! No respect, I tell ya!

## The Week's Big Winner: Mike's Team Goes Nuclear
### *straightens tie* "This Guy Gets ALL the Respect!"

Mike's Team put up 134 points this week - that's more points than I've gotten compliments in my entire life! And trust me, that's not a high bar. My wife told me she likes me better when I'm sleeping - I said "Great, you look better with my eyes closed too!" But Mike, this guy's different. He's got the Midas touch, except instead of gold, everything turns to fantasy points.

His dynamic duo of Jahmyr Gibbs and Quinshon Judkins was unstoppable - Gibbs dropped 31 points while Judkins added another 30! These two were running through defenses like my wife runs through my credit cards. I tell ya, these guys had more yards than my neighbor's got excuses for not returning my lawn mower. Spencer Rattler even chipped in 16 points off the bench - even Mike's backups are scoring more than some teams' starters! That's like my understudy getting more applause than me... which happens every night!

The only dark spot for Mike was losing Mike Evans to a broken collarbone - but with the week he had, that's like complaining about a hangnail after winning the lottery. The guy's so lucky, if he fell into a septic tank, he'd come out smelling like cologne. Meanwhile, if I fell into a barrel of breasts, I'd come out sucking my thumb! No respect whatsoever!

## The Matchup Breakdowns: Six Tales of Triumph and Tragedy
### *wipes brow* "These Games Had More Drama Than My Therapy Sessions!"

### Chris's Team (128.5) defeats Dan's Team (116.5)
*adjusts collar* "A Battle of the Not-Quite-Elite!"

Chris came out swinging this week with 128.5 points, beating Dan's respectable 116.5. It was closer than my relationship with failure - which is to say, very close! Chris rode Dak Prescott's 24 points and Josh Jacobs' 19 points to victory. Even Rashee Rice managed 16 points, which is more than I've ever gotten from rice - usually it just gives me gas!

But here's the kicker - Chris had a whole graveyard of zeros on his bench! TreVeyon Henderson, Tony Pollard, Jameson Williams, and Rome Odunze all put up donuts. That's more zeros than my bank statement! I tell ya, if zeros were worth points, Chris would be undefeated. It's like bringing a gun to a knife fight but forgetting the bullets - you still win, but it could've been easier!

Dan fought valiantly with his quarterback carousel - Jalen Hurts with 27 points and Aaron Rodgers with 26. Two quarterbacks combining for 53 points! That's like having two wives who both actually like you - theoretically possible but highly unlikely! Davante Adams added 24 points and Travis Hunter contributed 17, but it wasn't enough. Dan's team performed like my comedy career - pretty good, but never quite good enough to get the respect it deserves!

The final margin of 12 points was about as comfortable as my pants after Thanksgiving dinner - technically fitting, but you know it could go either way. Chris moves on with the W, while Dan's left wondering what could've been, like me every time I see a happy couple!

### Mitch's Team (59.5) gets demolished by Pete's Team (95.5)
*fumbles with microphone* "This Wasn't a Game, It Was a Crime Scene!"

Oh boy, Mitch's team... I haven't seen a beating this bad since... well, since every day of my childhood! 59.5 points? That's not a fantasy score, that's a failing grade! And I should know - I got plenty of those in school. My teacher told me I was the worst student she ever had. I said "Thank you, that must be why you kept me back three years!"

Mitch had more zeros than a binary code convention! Chuba Hubbard - zero! Brian Robinson Jr. - zero! George Kittle - zero! Cooper Kupp - zero! Kareem Hunt - zero! Samaje Perine - zero! It was like watching my investment portfolio - everything going down and nothing going up! The only bright spot was Keenan Allen with 17 points, but that's like having one good tooth in a mouth full of cavities - technically helpful, but you're still in trouble!

Meanwhile, Pete cruised to 95.5 points with Matthew Stafford leading the charge at 31 points. Stafford was throwing touchdowns like I throw out self-deprecating jokes - constantly and with surprising accuracy! D'Andre Swift added 17 points, and even with Brandon Aiyuk still nursing that knee injury, Pete had enough firepower to make this a laugher.

The 36-point margin of victory was bigger than the gap between my self-esteem and normal people's. Mitch's team performed like my love life - lots of potential, zero execution! I tell ya, Mitch should get hazard pay for having to watch that performance!

### Joe's Team (99.5) edges out Eli's Team (93.0)
*nervously adjusts tie* "This One Was Tighter Than My Budget!"

Joe squeaked by with 99.5 points against Eli's 93.0 - a margin closer than me and bankruptcy court! Joe's secret weapon was Jonathan Taylor, who exploded for 30 points. Taylor was running through holes bigger than the ones in my life story! That one performance was worth more than my entire net worth - which, granted, isn't saying much since I owe more money than a small country's GDP!

Eli fought back with Patrick Mahomes' 24 points, but had his own cemetery of zeros. David Montgomery, Matthew Golden, Tua Tagovailoa, and T.J. Hockenson all laid eggs bigger than my aunt Mildred - and she was a big woman! CeeDee Lamb managed 17 points and Trey McBride added 19, but when half your team doesn't show up, you're fighting with one hand tied behind your back - which coincidentally is how I fight naturally!

The 6.5-point victory margin was about as comfortable as a prostate exam - technically successful but nobody's enjoying it! Joe walks away with the win while Eli's left wondering why his players treated game day like it was optional, kind of like how my kids treat visiting me!

### Aaron's Team (96.5) falls to Bruce's Team (118.0)
*wipes sweat* "Bruce's Team Had More Firepower Than a Military Base!"

Bruce's team came out firing on all cylinders with 118 points! Bo Nix alone dropped 39 points - that's more points than I've scored in my entire romantic life! And Daniel Jones added 21 points as the backup! When your backup quarterback scores 21, you're doing something right. When my backup plan works, it usually involves sleeping on the couch!

Bruce also got 20 points from Ja'Marr Chase and even Drake Maye contributed 19. The only setback was Brock Bowers being out with a knee injury, but when you're scoring 118 points, that's like complaining about a scratch on your Lamborghini - sure, it's annoying, but you're still driving a Lamborghini! Meanwhile, I'm over here with a bus pass that expired in 2019!

Aaron managed 96.5 points despite having both Kyler Murray and Jakobi Meyers sidelined with injuries. That's like trying to win a race with two flat tires - theoretically possible but you're gonna have a bad time! Jaxson Dart tried to keep them in it with 32 points, and Javonte Williams added 17, but it wasn't enough. Aaron's team performed like my stand-up career - some bright moments, but ultimately disappointing!

The 21.5-point margin was bigger than the gap between my expectations and reality. Bruce moves on victorious while Aaron's left to nurse his wounds - both literal and figurative, just like me after every family gathering!

### Cal's Team (85.0) gets crushed by Mike's Team (134.0)
*pulls at collar desperately* "This Was Less of a Game and More of a Public Execution!"

Cal's team put up 85 points, which sounds decent until you realize Mike dropped 134 on him! That's a 49-point beatdown - I haven't seen a gap that big since my wife and I tried couples yoga! Cal had Jaxon Smith-Njigba contribute 17 points, but then had a parade of zeros: Ashton Jeanty, Drake London, Caleb Williams, and Dylan Sampson all decided to take the week off. That's more no-shows than my birthday parties!

Meanwhile, Mike was operating a fantasy football printing press! As we mentioned, Gibbs with 31, Judkins with 30, and Rattler with 16 - even his injured Mike Evans couldn't slow down this juggernaut. Mike's team was scoring points like I accumulate medical bills - rapidly and without mercy!

The 49-point massacre was harder to watch than my wedding video - and that includes the parts where I'm crying! Cal's team looked like my investment portfolio after I take financial advice from my brother-in-law - completely destroyed! This wasn't a loss, it was a humanitarian crisis!

### Sean's Team (112.0) falls to Matt's Team (117.0)
*frantically loosens tie* "The Closest Call Since My Last Heart Scare!"

This barn burner came down to the wire with Matt edging Sean 117 to 112! Matt rode Christian McCaffrey's 28 points to victory - McCaffrey was carrying Matt's team like I carry emotional baggage: constantly and with visible strain! A.J. Brown added 25 points and DeVonta Smith chipped in 20. That receiving duo was more in sync than my anxieties and my therapist's vacation schedule!

Sean fought back with an unusual two-quarterback attack - Justin Herbert with 30 points and Joe Flacco with 27! Two quarterbacks combining for 57 points is like having two mothers-in-law who both hate you - impressive in its consistency! Chris Olave added 22 points, but Sean's Kendre Miller being on injured reserve hurt them more than my jokes hurt my career prospects!

The 5-point margin was tighter than my pants after the holidays - technically still functional but one wrong move and it's over! Matt survives and advances while Sean's left wondering what might have been if he'd just gotten one more touchdown - story of my life, always one break away from success!

## Performance Tier Analysis
### *exhausted sigh* "The Haves, Have-Nots, and Have-No-Hopes!"

Looking at the week's performances, we got more tiers than my wedding cake - and that thing was huge because my wife insisted on inviting everyone, including people I've never met! At the top, we got the elite tier with Mike (134.0) sitting alone like me at a party - except he's there because he's too good for everyone else, I'm there because nobody wants to talk to me!

The competitive tier features Chris (128.5), Bruce (118.0), and Matt (117.0) - these guys are like the middle class of fantasy football, doing well but still one bad week away from disaster. Kind of like my comedy career - successful enough to keep going but not successful enough to quit my day job!

Then there's the struggling tier with Sean (112.0), Joe (99.5), Aaron (96.5), and Pete (95.5). These teams are like my health - not terrible, but definitely could be better and probably need some attention!

And in the basement, we got Dan (116.5 but still lost), Eli (93.0), Cal (85.0), and poor Mitch (59.5). The gap between Mike's 134 and Mitch's 59.5 is 74.5 points - that's bigger than the gap between my self-image and reality! Mitch is so far behind, he'd need a telescope to see the leader!

## The Bust Brigade
### *defeated shrug* "These Guys Had More Zeros Than My Self-Worth!"

This week's bust list reads like my list of accomplishments - surprisingly long and full of disappointments! We had more zeros than a math textbook! Caleb Williams, Chuba Hubbard, David Montgomery, Cooper Kupp, George Kittle - these guys were supposed to be studs but performed like duds! 

It's like they all got together and decided to have a "who can disappoint their owner most" contest - and everybody won! Or lost, depending on how you look at it. These players put up more goose eggs than a Canadian poultry farm! I tell ya, if disappointment was worth points, these guys would be Hall of Famers!

## Close Calls and Heartbreaks
### *nervous laugh* "These Games Were Tighter Than My Wallet!"

The Sean vs. Matt thriller came down to just 5 points! That's closer than me and poverty - which is to say, extremely close! Sean had 57 points from his quarterbacks but still lost! That's like doing everything right and still failing - story of my life! And Joe's 6.5-point win over Eli was about as comfortable as a dentist appointment - you survived, but you're not eager to do it again!

## Looking Ahead
### *straightens tie one last time* "Next Week Can't Be Worse... Can It?"

As we head into Week 8, the playoff picture is starting to form like my bald spot - slowly but inevitably! Mike's Team is running away with it faster than my wife with the credit cards. Meanwhile, Mitch needs a miracle bigger than my career revival - and that's saying something because I've been waiting for that revival since 1967!

The middle of the pack is tighter than my collar after Thanksgiving dinner. Every game matters now, unlike my opinions at family gatherings! Teams need to start making moves or they'll be watching the playoffs from the sidelines, just like I watch successful comedians - with envy and confusion!

## Injury Report
### *grimaces* "The Walking Wounded... Or Not Walking, As It Were!"

- **Aaron's Team**: Jakobi Meyers (LV, WR) - Out with knee/toe; Kyler Murray (ARI, QB) - Out with foot

*Adjusts tie one final time and walks off stage*

I tell ya, this league gives me no respect at all! But hey, at least I'm not Mitch this week - now THAT guy really gets no respect! Thank you, you've been a wonderful audience. I'll be here all week - not by choice, my car got repossessed! Try the veal and tip your waitress - she needs it more than I do, and that's saying something! No respect, no respect at all!

*Exit stage left, still tugging at collar*
