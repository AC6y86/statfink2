# Week 15 Fantasy Football Recap: A Completely Normal Week Where Nothing Weird Happened

## Setting the Scene

So it's Week 15. The playoffs. This is the week where everybody acts like they've been taking it seriously all year, even though I know for a fact that some of y'all were starting guys whose names you couldn't pronounce three months ago. But that's fine. That's totally fine. We're here now. The regular season is over, and somehow we've arrived at the playoffs with all twelve teams still having a mathematical pulse, which is nice because math is the only thing some of these rosters have going for them.

The league average this week was 110.5 points. That sounds impressive until you realize that includes Cal putting up 174 points like he was playing a different sport entirely. Without him, we're probably looking at like... I don't know, something less impressive. I'm not great at math either, which is why I'm doing fantasy football recaps instead of being an accountant. My wife wanted me to be an accountant. I became a comedian instead. She still brings it up sometimes. But anyway, Week 15.

Here's the thing about playoff fantasy football - everybody starts making decisions they think are smart. "I'm going to start this guy because the weather in Buffalo looks favorable." Brother, the weather in Buffalo is never favorable. It's Buffalo. But we make these choices and then we live with them, which is basically the theme of this entire league.

## The Headliner: Cal Goes Absolutely Nuclear

Cal put up 174 points this week. That's not a typo. One hundred and seventy-four. To put that in perspective, that's more than Mike and Mitch combined. It's almost more than some people score in two weeks. Cal did it in one Sunday, just casually, like he was making a sandwich.

Trevor Lawrence - a guy who most people forgot still existed in the NFL - scored 48 points. Forty-eight. From a Jaguar. In December. I don't understand it either, but I'm not going to question it. Trevor Lawrence was like that uncle who shows up to Thanksgiving after disappearing for two years and just starts dominating at Cornhole. Nobody knows where he's been or why he's suddenly good, but here we are.

Then you've got Kyle Pitts with 36 points. Kyle Pitts! The guy fantasy owners have been complaining about for three years finally remembered he's supposed to be good at football. Add in Bijan Robinson with 20, Tyrone Tracy Jr. with 19, and Caleb Williams with 16, and you've got yourself a week that Cal's grandchildren will hear about. "Let me tell you about Week 15 of 2025, kids. Your grandfather was a god among men that day." And the grandkids will be like, "That's great, Grandpa, but what's fantasy football?" Because by then we'll all be playing fantasy robot soccer or something.

## The Playoff Matchups

### Championship Semifinal: Chris Defeats Dan, 140.0 - 124.5

This was supposed to be a close game. I mean, it kind of was a close game. Fifteen and a half points isn't that much in our scoring system. But it also wasn't that close, you know what I mean? It's like when someone says, "The basketball game was competitive," and then you look and one team won by 14. Sure, it wasn't a blowout, but nobody's making a documentary about it.

Chris rolled out there with TreVeyon Henderson dropping 25 points. TreVeyon Henderson! A Patriots rookie running back! In 2025 the Patriots are so bad they've got running backs nobody's heard of putting up fantasy numbers. That's how life works sometimes - chaos at the franchise level becomes points for Chris. Josh Allen added 21, because Josh Allen always adds around 21. He's like the most consistent player in fantasy. You could set your watch to Josh Allen's production if watches still existed and people still used them. Josh Jacobs chipped in 19, Tony Pollard had 17, and Jameson Williams added another 17. A very respectable, very boring team win.

Dan needed his studs to show up, and some of them did. Kyren Williams led the way with 22 points, which is solid but not spectacular. Aaron Rodgers had 16, which for Aaron Rodgers in 2025 feels like a lot. Troy Franklin and Saquon Barkley each had 14. The problem - and this is a real problem, Dan - is that Kenneth Walker put up a goose egg. Zero. Nothing. He just didn't do anything. Deebo Samuel? Zero. Raheem Mostert? Zero. Marvin Mims? Zero. When you've got four guys scoring zero points in the playoffs, that's not ideal. That's what we call "not ideal" in the business. Dan played a lineup that was part fantasy team, part ghost squad.

So Chris moves on to face Matt for the championship. Dan drops to the third-place game against Bruce. That's the thing about fantasy playoffs - you win, you're still playing. You lose, you're also still playing, but now it's for third place, which is like winning a bronze medal at the Olympics if the Olympics only had twelve athletes and most of them were confused about the rules.

### Third Place Semifinal: Matt Defeats Bruce, 108.0 - 91.0

Here's a matchup that mattered for seeding purposes but also felt very much like two teams that knew they weren't winning the championship. Matt won by 17 points, which sounds decisive, but when you're looking at 108 and 91, you're really just watching two guys trying not to embarrass themselves.

Matt's big day came from an unusual source: J.J. McCarthy with 27 points. The Minnesota Vikings rookie quarterback. I'll be honest, I had to look up if J.J. McCarthy was even starting. Turns out he is, and turns out he's pretty good. Who knew? Matt knew, apparently, which is why Matt's going to finish in the top four and some of us aren't. C.J. Stroud added 24, DJ Moore had 19, and Christian McCaffrey contributed 11. Derrick Henry only scored 9, which feels like a misprint, but it's not. Sometimes Derrick Henry only scores 9, and we all just have to accept that.

Bruce came in hoping Bo Nix could carry him to victory. And you know what? Bo Nix tried. He really tried. 29 points from a sophomore quarterback is respectable. Drake Maye added 16 from New England, because apparently New England is now a quarterback factory for fantasy purposes only. DK Metcalf and Michael Wilson each had 11. But then you scroll down the roster and you see Ja'Marr Chase with 9 points. Ja'Marr Chase! The guy who was the consensus number one pick in a lot of leagues! Nine points in a playoff game. Brock Bowers had zero. Jerry Jeudy had zero. Fantasy football, man. It just takes things from you sometimes.

So Matt moves on to face Chris for the championship. Bruce drops to the third-place game against Dan. That's the bracket, baby. That's how playoff seeding works. You win your semifinal, you play for the title. You lose, you play for third. It makes sense when you think about it, which is more than I can say for most things in fantasy football.

## The Non-Playoff Teams: Still Scoring, Still Caring (Sort Of)

### Pete's Team: 130.0 Points

Pete put up 130 points in a week where it doesn't matter. That's so Pete. Jared Goff had 27, Nico Collins had 22, D'Andre Swift had 22, and Matthew Stafford also had 22. Four guys at 22 or higher. That's a playoff-worthy performance in a non-playoff week. Pete's team is like that guy who brings a really nice bottle of wine to a party that's already ending. We appreciate the effort, Pete. We really do.

### Joe's Team: 133.0 Points

Joe also put up a huge number that doesn't count for anything. James Cook led the way with 33 points, which is the second-highest individual score of the week. Jacoby Brissett and Jalen Hurts each had 21. Dallas Goedert had 19. But Joe also had six players score zero: Ladd McConkey, Xavier Worthy, Jaylen Warren, George Pickens, Jordan Mason, and Christian Kirk. Six zeros! In a week where he scored 133! Fantasy football is just deciding which half of your roster is going to show up, and then praying you guessed right.

### Eli's Team: 117.0 Points

Amon-Ra St. Brown dropped 28, Trey McBride had 25, and Tua Tagovailoa contributed 19. Solid performances across the board. Eli's team has been hovering around league average all year, which is exactly where you want to be if you're trying to be forgettable. No offense, Eli. Actually, some offense. But it's gentle offense.

### Aaron's Team: 81.0 Points

Aaron had a rough week. Jaxson Dart was his leading scorer with 19 points. That's his LEADING scorer. Jaxson Dart. A rookie who most people don't know is playing. Jauan Jennings had 16, which is nice for a guy who was a waiver wire pickup three weeks ago. But when half your roster is zeroes because of injuries - including Jayden Daniels, Kyler Murray, and Mark Andrews - you're going to have weeks like this. Aaron's team right now is held together by duct tape and prayer.

### Mike's Team: 74.5 Points

Mike's week can be summarized as follows: Baker Mayfield (21), Jordan Love (14), some other guys, and then a LOT of zeroes. Jahmyr Gibbs scored zero. Romeo Doubs scored zero. Daniel Carlson, the kicker, scored zero. When your kicker scores zero, you know something went wrong. Mike finished with 74.5 points, which is below the league average by about 36 points. That's not good. That's the opposite of good. But Mike's out of the playoffs anyway, so it's really more of a pride issue at this point.

### Sean's Team: 76.0 Points

Travis Etienne led Sean's squad with 27 points, which is great. The problem is that Justin Jefferson scored zero, Breece Hall scored zero, and Jaylen Waddle scored zero. Those are supposed to be the good players. Those are the names you brag about at the draft. "I got Jefferson, Hall, AND Waddle!" And then in Week 15, they combine for nothing. Zero. A big goose egg. Sean finished with 76 points, which at least was more than Mike.

### Mitch's Team: 77.0 Points

Mitch had Brock Purdy (24), George Kittle (14), Puka Nacua (12), and then a bunch of players who apparently forgot they were supposed to play football. Lamar Jackson only scored 10, which is low for Lamar. And then Chuba Hubbard, Brian Robinson Jr., Cooper Kupp, Stefon Diggs, Kareem Hunt, and Keenan Allen all combined for... zero. Zero points. Six players, no points. That's impressively bad. Mitch is really going through something this season.

## The Bust Brigade

Let's talk about the players who let their owners down, because that's the real story of fantasy football. It's not about the guys who showed up. It's about the guys who made you look like a fool for believing in them.

Ja'Marr Chase: 9 points. This is a guy who was drafted in the first round of most leagues. Nine points in a playoff week. That's going to haunt Bruce. Kenneth Walker III: zero. Breece Hall: zero. Justin Jefferson: zero. Jahmyr Gibbs: zero. These are ALL supposed to be studs. All of them. They combined for nothing. It's like the fantasy football gods got together and said, "You know what would be funny? If all the good players just... didn't play well." And then they laughed and ate whatever gods eat. Probably clouds or something.

The amount of zero-point performances this week was genuinely alarming. We had at least twenty players across all rosters score exactly nothing. That's a lot of nothing. That's a concerning amount of nothing.

---

## Close Calls and Heartbreaks

The Chris vs. Dan matchup was the closest of the two playoff games, with Chris winning by 15.5 points. In a normal week, that's a reasonable margin. In the playoffs, it feels like a blowout because every point matters more when there's something on the line. Dan needed one or two of his zero-point players to actually show up, and they just... didn't. That's fantasy football. You can do everything right and still lose because Kenneth Walker decided to take the week off.

Matt vs. Bruce was a 17-point margin, which is more comfortable but still not insurmountable. If Bruce's Ja'Marr Chase had played like Ja'Marr Chase - like the guy who won people championships last year - we might be having a different conversation. But he didn't, so we're not.

---

## Looking Ahead: Week 16 Championship and Third Place Game

Next week we've got the matchups that matter:

**Championship Game: Chris vs. Matt**
Chris has been the best team all season, averaging 113.6 points per week. Matt won his semifinal by riding J.J. McCarthy and C.J. Stroud to victory. Two solid teams, two different approaches. Chris should be the favorite, but fantasy football doesn't care about favorites. Fantasy football cares about chaos.

**Third Place Game: Bruce vs. Dan**
Two teams that came up short fighting for the bronze. Bruce has the name-brand players like Ja'Marr Chase but they didn't show up this week. Dan had a similar problem with Kenneth Walker and Deebo Samuel going ghost. Should be interesting. Should be. "Should" is doing a lot of work in that sentence.

## Injury Report

Because nothing says "fun" like cataloging all the hurt people:

| Player | Team | Position | Owner | Status | Details |
|--------|------|----------|-------|--------|---------|
| Bam Knight | ARI | RB | Aaron | IR | Ankle injury, placed on IR Dec 16 |
| Jayden Daniels | WSH | QB | Aaron | Out | Elbow - shut down for final three games |
| Kyler Murray | ARI | QB | Aaron | IR | Foot injury, effectively done with Cardinals |
| Joe Mixon | HOU | RB | Eli | Out | Foot/ankle issues, unclear return |
| Patrick Mahomes | KC | QB | Eli | IR | Knee, placed on IR Dec 17 |
| Devin Neal | NO | RB | Mike | Out | Hamstring, ruled out for Week 16 |
| Cam Skattebo | NYG | RB | Mitch | IR | Ankle, since October |
| Michael Penix Jr. | ATL | QB | Mitch | IR | Full ACL reconstruction |
| Brandon Aiyuk | SF | WR | Pete | Out | Knee, placed on reserve list |
| Zach Ertz | WSH | TE | Pete | IR | Knee, IR since Dec 10 |

Aaron's roster is basically a MASH unit at this point. Three significant injuries will do that to you. Eli losing Mahomes late in the season is rough, even though he's out of playoff contention. And Pete losing Aiyuk and Ertz doesn't help anyone.

## Final Thoughts

Week 15 was... a week. Cal was unbelievably good. Chris and Matt won their playoff games and advanced to the championship. Dan and Bruce lost and moved to the third-place game that nobody wants to play in but somebody has to. And the rest of the league put up scores ranging from "not bad" to "genuinely concerning."

That's fantasy football. You show up, you start the guys you think are going to be good, and then you watch as some of them just decide not to play well. There's no explaining it. There's no predicting it. You just experience it and then talk about it with strangers on the internet who are also experiencing it.

See you next week for the championship. Chris vs. Matt. Bruce vs. Dan. The conclusion of another season of pretending that managing fake football teams is a legitimate hobby. It is a legitimate hobby. I'm very defensive about it. My wife thinks I should spend less time on fantasy football and more time on productive things. She might be right. She usually is.

But here we are. Week 16 awaits.
