# Week 12 Fantasy Football Recap: The Thanksgiving Dinner Table

**Season 2025, Week 12**

---

## Welcome to the Table, Family

*Pull up a chair, loosen that belt, and grab yourself a plate, because this Thanksgiving spread tells the whole story of Week 12 in our fantasy league.*

The dining room is packed, twelve place settings arranged around Grandma's finest tablecloth, and every dish on this table has something to prove. Some came straight from the oven, golden and glorious, while others... well, let's just say someone forgot to check if the oven was actually on. The aroma of triumph and the faint whiff of disappointment mix together in that familiar holiday way, and before we pass the gravy, we need to talk about what just happened.

This was supposed to be a peaceful gathering, but instead we witnessed absolute carnage. The average plate this week weighed in at 81.25 points, but the range from the centerpiece turkey to that sad casserole nobody touched stretched from 138.0 all the way down to 53.0 points. That's an 85-point gap between feast and famine, folks. Somebody is going home with nothing but an empty Tupperware container and wounded pride.

## The Golden Turkey: Joe's Team (138.0 points)

**The Centerpiece Nobody Can Stop Staring At**

Right there in the middle of the table, glistening under the chandelier like it was hand-crafted by the Pilgrims themselves, sits Joe's Team with a monstrous 138.0-point performance. This isn't just the turkey - this is the turkey that got a James Beard Award nomination, that made the cover of Bon Appetit, that has everyone asking for the recipe even though they know they'll never replicate it.

Jalen Hurts served as the golden, crispy skin of this magnificent bird, delivering 30.0 fantasy points on a stat line that included 289 passing yards, a passing touchdown, and TWO rushing scores. That dual-threat seasoning is what separates an elite turkey from your standard Butterball. Wan'Dale Robinson (20.0 points) was the perfectly rendered drippings, while James Cook III and George Pickens each contributed 17.0 points like two succulent drumsticks that everyone fights over. Even the backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett showed up with 14.0 points off the bench, because when your main course is this good, even the sides overdeliver.

Joe absolutely demolished Aaron 138.0 to 64.5, a 73.5-point massacre that felt less like a football game and more like watching someone bring a deep-fried turkey to a table full of microwaved Lean Cuisines. With this win, Joe improves to 10-2, tied for first place with Chris and sitting pretty on 1,479.5 total points. The playoff table is being set, and Joe has clearly called dibs on the best seat in the house.

## The Surprise Side Dishes: Overachievers Alert

### Mac and Cheese Supreme: Cal's Team (124.5 points)

Nobody expected the mac and cheese to steal the show, but here we are. Cal brought the comfort food that had everyone going back for seconds and thirds. Jaxon Smith-Njigba was the extra-sharp cheddar in this dish, exploding for 28.0 points on 167 receiving yards and two touchdowns. That's not just good - that's "hide the dish so nobody else can have any" good.

Trevor Lawrence added 24.0 points with three touchdown passes, while Caleb Williams chipped in 21.0 and rookie sensation Ashton Jeanty contributed 14.0 points. Cal's 124.5 points absolutely steamrolled Bruce's 63.0, a 61.5-point victory that felt like bringing homemade mac and cheese to a potluck where everyone else brought Kraft Easy Mac. Cal moves to 7-5 and has officially made themselves a playoff contender, climbing into fourth place with 1,275.5 total points.

### The Green Bean Casserole That Actually Slaps: Matt's Team (101.5 points)

Everyone rolled their eyes when Matt walked in with green bean casserole, but then they tasted it and realized this thing had been elevated. Derrick Henry (19.0 points) was the crispy onion topping, DJ Moore (19.0) provided the creamy base, and the dynamic duo of Christian McCaffrey and A.J. Brown (17.0 each) served as the perfectly cooked green beans themselves. Matt cruised past Eli 101.5 to 71.0, improving to 8-4 and solidifying that third-place standing with 1,065.5 total points.

### The Mashed Potatoes That Went Hard: Mike's Team (98.5 points)

You can't have Thanksgiving without mashed potatoes, and Mike's Team was the buttery, fluffy mountain of starch that anchored the entire meal. Jahmyr Gibbs was absolutely OBSCENE this week, piling up 39.0 fantasy points on 219 rushing yards and TWO rushing touchdowns, plus 45 receiving yards and ANOTHER touchdown. That's three total touchdowns from one player - the kind of performance that makes you push your plate away and just appreciate what you witnessed.

Quinshon Judkins added 16.0 points, and the supporting cast delivered just enough for Mike to cruise past Sean 98.5 to 67.0. Mike needed this win badly, improving to 5-7 and keeping faint playoff hopes alive. But honestly, who cares about the standings when you just watched Jahmyr Gibbs cook like that?

## The Matchup Breakdowns: Tales From Each End of the Table

### Chris vs. Mitch: The Cornbread vs. The Fruitcake (79.5-53.0)

Chris's Team entered this week riding high after dropping 155.0 points in Week 11, but the feast couldn't last forever. Still, 79.5 points was enough - the cornbread that's reliable, not spectacular, but gets the job done. Dak Prescott led the way with 30.0 points (354 passing yards, 2 TDs, and a rushing score), while Sam Darnold added 16.0 in a supporting role. The problem? Nearly half the roster put up zeroes or near-zeroes, with Tony Pollard, Jameson Williams, and Jordan Addison all contributing nothing.

Mitch's Team, meanwhile, was the fruitcake that Aunt Edna insists on bringing every year even though nobody touches it. With 53.0 points - the lowest score of the week - Mitch's dinner was a disaster. Lamar Jackson put up a goose egg. Chuba Hubbard? Zero. Brian Robinson Jr.? Zero. Cooper Kupp, Stefon Diggs, Xavier Legette? Zero, zero, zero. Kareem Hunt's 17.0 points and Brock Purdy's 11.0 were the only things keeping this dish from being completely inedible. Mitch falls to 5-7 and is now officially on the outside looking in at the playoff picture.

### Dan vs. Pete: The Cranberry Sauce Showdown (60.5-54.0)

This matchup was two dishes that nobody was particularly excited about, competing for the right to claim they're "not the worst thing on the table." Dan's 60.5 edged Pete's 54.0 in a battle that had all the excitement of watching two people argue about whether cranberry sauce should be homemade or canned.

Davante Adams carried Dan with 19.0 points, and Geno Smith added 14.0, but the rest of the roster was largely missing in action. Saquon Barkley - SAQUON BARKLEY - put up just 3.0 points. The man who's been destroying everyone all season brought nothing but disappointment to Thanksgiving dinner. Dan survives with a 6.5-point victory, moving to 5-7.

Pete's loss was equally frustrating. Matthew Stafford (24.0) and Jared Goff (19.0) both showed up, but nobody else wanted to play. D'Andre Swift? Zero. Travis Kelce? Zero. Pete falls to 6-6, still in the playoff hunt but needing to figure out why half their roster keeps no-showing.

### Eli vs. Matt: The Sweet Potato Casserole Gets Demolished (71.0-101.5)

Eli brought the sweet potato casserole - you know, the one with the marshmallows on top that's supposed to be a crowd-pleaser. But Matt's green bean casserole straight up embarrassed it. Eli's 71.0 points featured solid contributions from Amon-Ra St. Brown (17.0), Patrick Mahomes (14.0), and Darnell Mooney (11.0), but David Montgomery's zero, Joshua Palmer's zero, and T.J. Hockenson's zero meant this dish was half-raw when it came out of the oven.

Eli drops to 5-7 and needs to start winning immediately if they want to taste playoff glory. Meanwhile, Matt's victory keeps them firmly in third place, the reliable dish that everyone appreciates even if it doesn't get the most attention.

### Mike vs. Sean: The Potato Avalanche (98.5-67.0)

Mike's mashed potato mountain buried Sean's... honestly, what even was Sean's dish? It started promising with Cam Ward's 22.0 points and Travis Etienne's 14.0, but Justin Jefferson's goose egg was like forgetting to add salt to the entire meal. Breece Hall managed just 6.0 points, and the roster was littered with zeroes.

Sean falls to 3-9, officially the team that brought the dish everyone politely says "looks interesting" while secretly avoiding. Mike's win provides hope, but at 5-7, the path to the playoffs requires running the table.

## The Dish Nobody Touched: Aaron's Team (64.5 points)

Every Thanksgiving table has one - that mysterious casserole in the corner that everyone walks past, occasionally glancing at but never committing to. This week, that dish was Aaron's Team. Now, to be fair, Aaron was up against Joe's mighty turkey, so the 64.5 points was never going to be enough anyway. But the composition of this roster tells a sad story.

Jakobi Meyers led the team with 11.0 points. Eleven. That was the high score. Tetairoa McMillan, Zach Charbonnet, Jauan Jennings, and Bam Knight all contributed 8.0 points each - consistent mediocrity, the fantasy equivalent of a casserole that tastes exactly like nothing. Mark Andrews put up a zero. Tank Bigsby put up a zero. This is a 2-10 team that has scored just 940.0 total points on the season, and watching them try to compete is like watching someone bring a store-bought vegetable tray to a gourmet dinner party.

## The Bust Brigade: When the Recipe Goes Wrong

Sometimes you follow all the instructions and the dish still comes out wrong. This week's biggest disappointments included:

- **Saquon Barkley (Dan's Team): 3.0 points** - You draft Saquon to be your turkey, not your disappointing store-bought pie.
- **Justin Jefferson (Sean's Team): 0.0 points** - The star ingredient that somehow never made it into the dish.
- **Travis Kelce (Pete's Team): 0.0 points** - Grandma's famous recipe that just didn't translate this year.
- **Lamar Jackson (Mitch's Team): 0.0 points** - The main course that got food poisoning.
- **Alvin Kamara (Mike's Team): 0.0 points** - Left on the counter and forgotten entirely.
- **Jordan Love (Mike's Team): 0.0 points** - Somehow managed to be less useful than the decorative gourds.

## The Close Calls and Heartbreaks

The Dan vs. Pete matchup deserves special mention as the only truly competitive game this week - a 6.5-point margin in a battle of two teams trying not to be the worst dish on the table. In a week with blowouts of 73.5 points (Joe over Aaron), 61.5 points (Cal over Bruce), and 31.5 points (Mike over Sean), that Dan/Pete game was the only one where both teams could taste victory until the very end.

Dan's Davante Adams (19.0) outdueled Pete's Matthew Stafford (24.0), but the supporting casts told the story. Dan got just enough from Geno Smith and Khalil Shakir to edge out a team that had TWO quarterbacks scoring 19+ points but couldn't get production from anyone else.

## Looking Ahead: The Playoff Picture

The table is set for the final stretch, and here's how the standings look as we head into the final weeks:

**Locked In:** Chris (10-2) and Joe (10-2) have virtually guaranteed themselves playoff spots. These are the hosts of next week's dinner party.

**Comfortably Seated:** Matt (8-4) is in excellent position, while Cal (7-5) has climbed into the conversation with back-to-back strong performances.

**Fighting for Scraps:** Bruce and Pete (both 6-6), plus Mike, Dan, Eli, and Mitch (all 5-7) are in a massive logjam. Four teams at 5-7 fighting for what might be just one or two spots? That's Thanksgiving drama right there.

**Clearing the Table:** Sean (3-9) and Aaron (2-10) are officially on dish duty. Their seasons are over, but they can play spoiler for the teams fighting for their playoff lives.

## The Final Toast

*Raises glass*

To Joe, our magnificent turkey who dominated the spread. To Cal's surprise mac and cheese that stole the show. To Mike's Jahmyr Gibbs, who reminded us all why we love this game with a 39-point performance for the ages. And yes, even to Mitch's fruitcake - because every Thanksgiving needs something for the dog to eat under the table.

The playoffs are coming, the standings are tight in the middle, and next week promises to be another feast of fantasy football drama. Save some room for dessert, folks.

Happy Thanksgiving, and may your fantasy teams score as well as your actual turkey.
