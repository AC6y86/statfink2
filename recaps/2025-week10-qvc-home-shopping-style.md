**KAREN:** "Good evening, fantasy football shoppers! Oh my goodness, David, do we have an INCREDIBLE collection of performances for our viewers tonight! I'm literally shaking with excitement!"

**DAVID:** "Karen, in my 20 years of hosting QVC Fantasy Football, I have NEVER - and I mean NEVER - seen value like we're offering tonight! We've got premium performances at rock-bottom prices, and folks, these are FLYING off our shelves! The phone lines are already lighting up!"

**KAREN:** "That's right, David! And remember, shoppers - these Week 10 performances are LIMITED EDITION! Once they're gone, they're GONE FOREVER! You can't go back and get these points next week! Let's dive right into our FEATURED ITEM OF THE NIGHT!"

## 🌟 TODAY'S SPECIAL VALUE: CHRIS'S TEAM PREMIUM COLLECTION! 🌟

**DAVID:** "Oh wow, Karen! Look at this GORGEOUS 154-point performance from Chris's Team! This is NOT a drill, people! One hundred and fifty-four SPARKLING fantasy points defeating Cal's Team 154.0 to 122.5!"

**KAREN:** "David, let me tell you what you're getting in this EXCLUSIVE package! First, we have De'Von Achane - that's 31 STUNNING points of pure Miami Dolphins rushing excellence! But wait - BUT WAIT! - there's MORE!"

**DAVID:** "There IS more, Karen! You're also getting TreVeyon Henderson with 25 magnificent points! That's right, folks - the New England rookie sensation! And if you thought that was all... *dramatic pause* ...you'd be WRONG!"

**KAREN:** "Because we're ALSO including Josh Allen with 19 quarterback points! AND - I can't believe we're doing this - Tyler Allgeier with ANOTHER 19 points! And hold on to your remotes, because Jameson Williams is in there too with 17 DAZZLING receiving points!"

**DAVID:** "Folks, if you bought these performances separately at retail, you'd be looking at... *shuffles papers dramatically* ...let me do the math here... that's OVER 111 points just from these five players alone! But tonight, Chris got ALL of this PLUS more for one low matchup victory! The value is INSANE!"

**KAREN:** "And shoppers, Chris is now 8-2 on the season! That's ELITE status! You know what that means? PLAYOFF POSITIONING! This isn't just a win - it's an INVESTMENT in your fantasy future! Call now - 1-800-FANTASY - operators are standing by!"

## 💎 CLEARANCE CATASTROPHE: MATT'S TEAM WAREHOUSE BLOWOUT! 💎

**DAVID:** "Oh no, Karen! We need to talk about Matt's Team! This is painful, but we have to move this inventory!"

**KAREN:** "David, sometimes in the home shopping business, you get items that just... don't perform as expected. Matt's Team managed only 49.5 points against Aaron's Team's 74.0. That's right, shoppers - FORTY-NINE POINT FIVE!"

**DAVID:** "This is what we call a 'manager's special,' folks. Matt, who was 6-3 coming in, hit rock bottom this week. We're talking about a team that couldn't even crack 50 points! In the fantasy football world, that's like ordering a diamond ring and getting cubic zirconia!"

**KAREN:** "But here's the silver lining - Matt is STILL 6-4! Still in playoff contention! This could be the PERFECT buy-low opportunity! Remember, shoppers - even QVC has clearance days, and Matt's looking to restock with premium merchandise next week!"

**DAVID:** "Speaking of restocking, let's check our inventory levels... *frantically checking clipboard* ...Oh my! We're already 40% SOLD OUT of winning performances this week! Don't wait!"

## 🎯 THE JONATHAN TAYLOR SIGNATURE SERIES - ITEM #39POINTS! 🎯

**KAREN:** "Stop EVERYTHING you're doing right now! David, tell them about the Jonathan Taylor Signature Performance!"

**DAVID:** "Karen, I'm getting chills! THIRTY-NINE POINTS! That's 3-9, shoppers! From ONE player! Joe's Team featured this MUSEUM-QUALITY running back performance in their 134.0 to 93.5 DEMOLITION of Dan's Team!"

**KAREN:** "Let me paint you a picture here - Jonathan Taylor, Indianapolis Colts, delivering the SINGLE HIGHEST individual performance of the week! This isn't just points, this is ART! This is CRAFTSMANSHIP!"

**DAVID:** "And Joe didn't stop there! Oh no! He paired it with Mac Jones - 24 points! Jacoby Brissett - 21 points! Ladd McConkey - 17 points! This is what we call the 'Full Collection Experience'!"

**KAREN:** "Joe is now 8-2, folks! EIGHT AND TWO! That's co-leader status! That's CHAMPIONSHIP TRAJECTORY! And Dan... *sighs dramatically* ...poor Dan drops to 4-6. David, what happened to Dan's value proposition?"

**DAVID:** "Well, Karen, even with Kyren Williams' respectable 19 points and Marcus Mariota's 16, sometimes you run into a POWERHOUSE collection like Joe's. That's the nature of the fantasy shopping experience!"

---

## 🔥 FLASH SALE: MIKE'S JAHMYR GIBBS SPECTACULAR! 🔥

**KAREN:** "QUICK! QUICK! QUICK! We have a 5-minute FLASH SALE on Mike's performance!"

**DAVID:** "33 POINTS from Jahmyr Gibbs! THIRTY-THREE! But even with that Lions running back MASTERPIECE, Mike still fell 99.5 to 80.5 to Mike's Team!"

**KAREN:** "This is HEARTBREAKING, David! Mike had Gibbs' 33, Baker Mayfield's 24, Tez Johnson's 16... that's 73 points from just THREE players! But wait - there's a problem in the warehouse!"

**DAVID:** "That's right! Kayshon Boutte - RULED OUT! Zero points! This is why you ALWAYS check your inventory before game day, shoppers! One defective item can ruin your entire collection!"

**KAREN:** "Mike drops to 4-6, and folks, the phone lines are going CRAZY! People are calling in asking 'How do you score 99.5 points and LOSE?' Well, that's the magic of fantasy football home shopping - sometimes even great deals aren't enough!"

## 🏆 PETE'S QUARTERBACK COMBO PACK - LIMITED TIME OFFER! 🏆

**DAVID:** "Karen, I'm holding in my hands one of the most BALANCED performances we've seen all season!"

**KAREN:** "Oh, the Pete Special! 96.0 points defeating Sean's Team 94.0! Talk about a NAIL-BITER! We're talking about a TWO-POINT margin of victory! That's like getting an item for $96 when it's priced at $94.02!"

**DAVID:** "Pete masterfully combined Matthew Stafford's 29 points with Jared Goff's 24 points! That's 53 points from just the quarterback position! But here's the tragedy - Brandon Aiyuk was OUT! Zero points!"

**KAREN:** "And yet Pete STILL won! That's the sign of a QUALITY collection, shoppers! Even with missing pieces, the total package delivers! Pete improves to 5-5, right in the playoff hunt!"

**DAVID:** "Meanwhile, Sean drops to 3-7 despite Chris Olave's 17 points. But here's the REAL tragedy - Garrett Wilson OUT! Rhamondre Stevenson OUT! That's like ordering a complete dining set and having the chairs arrive broken!"

## 🎪 THE BUDGET BASEMENT: MITCH VS. BRUCE MARKDOWN MADNESS! 🎪

**KAREN:** "Now folks, not every item in our catalog can be a premium piece, and that brings us to our Budget Basement matchup!"

**DAVID:** "Mitch's Team managed just 78.5 points, falling to Bruce's 67.5. Wait, Karen, I'm reading this wrong... *adjusts glasses* ...no, that's right! Mitch LOST with 78.5 points!"

**KAREN:** "This is what happens when you shop in the clearance section, David! Both teams were working with LIMITED inventory! Mitch had Cam Skattebo on IR! Terry McLaurin OUT! It's like trying to host a dinner party with half your dishes missing!"

**DAVID:** "But Bruce made it work with Drake Maye's 19 points and Daniel Jones' 17! Sometimes, shoppers, it's not about having the MOST expensive items - it's about having the RIGHT items at the RIGHT time!"

**KAREN:** "Bruce improves to 6-4! That's WINNING RECORD territory! Mitch falls to 4-6, and folks, the playoff window is CLOSING FAST! It's like a 48-hour sale that's down to its last 6 hours!"

**KAREN:** "Our PLATINUM COLLECTION - that's Chris and Joe, both at 8-2 with over 1,250 total points on the season! These are your LUXURY items, folks! The Tiffany of fantasy football!"

**DAVID:** "Then we have our GOLD COLLECTION - Bruce and Matt at 6-4! Solid, dependable, still sparkling with possibility! These teams are like that classic jewelry piece that never goes out of style!"

**KAREN:** "Our SILVER COLLECTION features Cal, Pete, and Eli, all at 5-5! Right on the bubble! It's like those items that could either become collector's pieces or end up in next season's clearance!"

**DAVID:** "And then... *voice drops* ...we have our CLEARANCE RACK. Dan, Mike, and Mitch at 4-6, Sean at 3-7, and Aaron... *whispers* ...2-8."
