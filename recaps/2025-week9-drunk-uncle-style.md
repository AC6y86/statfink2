# Week 9 Recap: A Drunk Uncle's Thanksgiving Manifesto
*As told by Uncle Gary after his sixth Miller Lite and third helping of stuffing*

## "LISTEN HERE, SPORT... *HICCCUP*... LET ME TELL YA BOUT WEEK 9"

*[Uncle Gary slams his beer down on the table, gravy stains on his Lions jersey from 1987]*

Alright, alright, ALRIGHT! Everybody shut up about the turkey for ONE GODDAMN MINUTE and lemme tell ya what REALLY happened in fantasy this week. Week 9! NINE! That's... that's like... *counts on fingers*... more than halfway through the season, and I got OPINIONS, nephew!

First off, lemme tell ya something about this whole fantasy football racket - it's RIGGED! You hear me? RIGGED! Just like when they stopped letting Barry Sanders run the ball because he was making everyone else look bad. That's a FACT. Look it up on the Google! But anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, Week 9...

*[Takes another swig, misses mouth slightly]*

## THE CHRIS-MAS MIRACLE (OR WAS IT?)

So get this - Christian's team... wait, no, CHRIS's team - not Christian McCaffrey, that's a different guy, keep up! - Chris puts up ONE TWENTY-EIGHT POINT FIVE! That's like... that's more points than the Lions scored in the entire 2008 season! *laughs at own joke* 

But HERE'S what they don't want you to know - Josh Allen scored 30 points for him, RIGHT? And Sam Darnold - SAM FREAKIN' DARNOLD who couldn't hit water if he fell out of a boat when he was with the Jets - suddenly he's putting up 32 points? That's not natural! That's CHEMICALS in the water supply! Wake up, sheeple!

Meanwhile, poor Mike - or was it Mark? Mickey? - whatever, the guy with Mike's Team only scores 64.5 points. SIXTY-FOUR POINT FIVE! That's not even a passing grade in remedial math! You know what happened? His whole team got the yips. Jahmyr Gibbs? ZERO POINTS! Alvin Kamara? GOOSE EGG! That's not bad luck, that's SABOTAGE! I bet Chris paid off the equipment managers to put itching powder in their jock straps. That's what I would do!

*[Accidentally knocks over salt shaker, doesn't notice]*

Tee Higgins tried to save the day with 27 points but you can't... you can't win a war with one soldier! That's what my buddy Randy learned in 'Nam. Or was it Panama? Doesn't matter. Point is, Mike got DESTROYED worse than my liver at this family gathering!

## THE BATTLE OF THE MEDIOCRES (AARON VS. MITCH)

Now THIS is where it gets INTERESTING! *leans in conspiratorially, breath could strip paint*

Aaron's team squeaks by Mitchell's team 95 to 91.5, and you wanna know why? Because JAXON DIRT... wait, Jaxson DART - stupid new-age names - that quarterback nobody's ever heard of scores 27 points! TWENTY-SEVEN! Meanwhile, Mitch has LAMAR JACKSON - the guy who runs faster than my nephew Todd running from child support - and he only gets 26 points! 

*[Stands up suddenly, wobbles slightly]*

THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! The NFL doesn't want running quarterbacks to succeed anymore because it makes the pocket passers look bad! It's a CONSPIRACY orchestrated by the Manning family! Eli's probably in on it too - look at his team, only scored 63.5 points this week! COINCIDENCE? I THINK NOT!

But here's the REAL kicker - *laughs at pun* - Mitch had FOUR guys score ZERO! FOUR! Chuba Hubbard, George Kittle, Keenan Allen, and some kid named Xavier Legette who sounds like a French pastry! You can't make this stuff up! Actually, maybe you can... maybe that's what they're doing... making it all up...

*[Sits back down heavily]*

## DAN THE MAN VS. ELI THE... UH... GUY

Dan beats Eli 93.5 to 63.5, and lemme tell ya why - Geno Smith! GENO! The guy the Jets threw away like last week's tuna casserole scores 29 points! You know what that proves? The JETS are in on it too! They deliberately tank players' careers so they can succeed elsewhere! It's all part of the plan!

*[Pointing with turkey leg]*

Poor Eli though... Joe Mixon - OUT! Joshua Palmer - OUT! The injury report longer than the line at the DMV! But that's what happens when you don't pay protection money to the fantasy gods! I've been leaving shots of whiskey by my computer every Sunday morning since 2003, and look at me! I'm... wait, I'm not in this league... BUT IF I WAS!

Eli's team had more zeros than a Japanese fighter plane squadron! Matthew Golden - ZERO! Darnell Mooney - ZERO! It's like his whole team decided to take a union-mandated break at the same time! That's what happens when you let the players unionize! Back in my day, they played through EVERYTHING! Broken legs, concussions, divorce proceedings - EVERYTHING!

## PETER, PAUL AND MATTHEW... WAIT, THAT'S NOT RIGHT

*[Squints at imaginary notes on palm]*

Pete versus Matt! The battle of the Biblical names! Or wait, is Pete short for Peter? Doesn't matter! Pete wins 92 to 89.5 in what I call a SLOBBERKNOCKER! That's a technical term!

Matthew Stafford - and there's ANOTHER Matthew, see what I mean about the conspiracy? - scores 29 points for Pete, proving once and for all that Detroit QBs only succeed AFTER leaving Detroit! It's the CURSE OF BOBBY LAYNE! He said the Lions wouldn't win for 50 years, but what he REALLY meant was their quarterbacks would haunt other teams with success!

*[Drops voice to whisper]*

But here's what REALLY grinds my gears - Christian McCaffrey scores 28 points for Matt's team and they STILL lose! You know why? Because A.J. Brown was OUT! Isiah Pacheco was OUT! It's like the injury gods looked at Matt's roster and said "You know what would be funny?" That's not football, that's VOODOO!

## JOE VS. CAL: THE HEAVYWEIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT

Now THIS pisses me off! *slams table again*

Joe - good ol' regular Joe, probably drives a pickup truck and drinks domestic beer like a REAL American - scores 107.5 points! Respectable! But Cal... CAL! With his fancy California name... scores 125.5! 

*[Standing up again, swaying]*

You wanna know the REAL story? Caleb Williams - 35 points! Drake London - 33 points! That's 68 points from TWO GUYS! That's not fair! That's like bringing a bazooka to a knife fight! Or a knife to a... wait, that's backwards... 

But HERE'S the thing nobody's talking about - Jacoby Brissett scored 27 points for Joe! JACOBY BRISSETT! The guy who's been a backup since the Truman administration! And Rico Dowdle - RICO DOWDLE, which sounds like a rejected Muppet - scored 25! These aren't REAL players! They're CRISIS ACTORS hired by the deep state fantasy cabal!

*[Nearly knocks over gravy boat]*

Cal had FIVE players score ZERO though! FIVE! Including Tyler Warren who I'm pretty sure is just two kids in a uniform! But it didn't matter because when you got Drake London catching passes from... wait, he doesn't catch from Caleb Williams... THIS IS WHAT I MEAN! THE MATH DOESN'T ADD UP! WAKE UP!

## THE BRUCE WAYNE VS. SEAN CONNERY... WAIT, THAT'S NOT RIGHT EITHER

*[Squinting harder, possibly seeing double]*

Bruce versus Sean! 112.5 to 112.0! POINT FIVE DIFFERENCE! You know what that is? That's SUSPICIOUS is what that is! 

*[Whispering loudly]*

They probably PLANNED this to make it look exciting! Bruce had BROCK BOWERS - which sounds like a porn name, just saying - score 33 points! And Daniel Jones... DANIEL JONES! The guy who trips over his own feet running for touchdowns suddenly remembers how to play football and scores 25 points? 

I'll tell you what happened - Bruce made a DEAL. Probably with the same people who made sure the Giants drafted him in the first place! It's all connected! The Mara family, the Illuminati, and Big Fantasy Football!

*[Voice rising again]*

But Sean had Joe Flacco score 37 points! JOE FLACCO! The guy's been washed since the Coolidge administration! He's so old he remembers when forward passes were illegal! But somehow - SOMEHOW - he's the week's second-highest scorer? That's not football, that's WITCHCRAFT!

Justin Herbert scored 30 for Sean too, which makes sense because he's actually good, but that ruins my theory so forget I said that part.

## THE INJURY REPORT (OR AS I CALL IT, THE COWARD'S LIST)

*[Pulls out reading glasses, puts them on upside down]*

Look at all these QUITTERS! 

- Zamir White - OUT! Probably faking it!
- Hassan Haskins - INJURED RESERVE! That's just a fancy way of saying "I don't feel like playing!"
- Joe Mixon - OUT with a foot/ankle! Pick ONE, Joe! You can't have both!
- Brock Purdy - OUT with a TOE! A TOE! In my day, we didn't even HAVE toes!
- Cooper Kupp - OUT with heel AND hamstring! Again with the multiple injuries! It's like a buffet of excuses!
- Terry McLaurin - might be out through Week 12! That's called PLANNING YOUR VACATION!

*[Throws glasses somewhere]*

And don't even get me STARTED on Brandon Aiyuk, Bucky Irving, D'Andre Swift, Ricky Pearsall, Garrett Wilson, and Rhamondre Stevenson! That's not a casualty list, that's a CONSPIRACY! They're all sitting out to drive their value down so they can... wait, that doesn't make sense... or DOES it?

## THE PERFORMANCE TIER MANIFESTO

*[Drawing imaginary chart on table with finger]*

Let me break this down for you like you're five, because apparently that's what it takes these days!

**THE ELITE TIER** (The Illuminati's Chosen Ones):
- Chris's Team: 128.5 points - CLEARLY juicing
- Cal's Team: 125.5 points - West Coast bias
- Bruce's Team: 112.5 points - Paid off the refs
- Sean's Team: 112.0 points - So close it's suspicious
- Joe's Team: 107.5 points - The people's champion

**THE MEDIOCRE MIDDLE** (The Forgotten Fighters):
- Aaron's Team: 95.0 points - Just happy to be here
- Dan's Team: 93.5 points - Trying his best
- Pete's Team: 92.0 points - Stafford can't save everyone
- Mitch's Team: 91.5 points - Lamar Jackson is OVERPAID

**THE BASEMENT BOYS** (The Sacrifice Zone):
- Matt's Team: 89.5 points - McCaffrey can't carry everyone
- Mike's Team: 64.5 points - Should consider retirement
- Eli's Team: 63.5 points - The other Manning curse

*[Stands up for emphasis, knocks chair over]*

You see the PATTERN? The gap between the top and bottom is 65 POINTS! SIXTY-FIVE! That's not competition, that's CLASS WARFARE!

## THE BUST BRIGADE (AKA THE HALL OF SHAME)

*[Voice getting hoarse but louder]*

Let me tell you about DISAPPOINTMENT! These overpaid PRIMA DONNAS:

- Jahmyr Gibbs - ZERO! The Lion who forgot how to roar!
- Alvin Kamara - ZERO! More like Alvin Kama-NAH!
- Jonathan Taylor - ZERO! Should change his name to Jonathan Stands-Still!
- George Kittle - ZERO! The people's tight end? More like the people's DISAPPOINTMENT!
- Jordan Addison, Rome Odunze - BOTH ZEROS! That's what happens when you got fancy names!

*[Pointing at nobody in particular]*

These guys make MILLIONS and can't score a SINGLE POINT? I scored more points at the church softball game last summer, and I was DRUNK! Well, drunker than now!

## CLOSE CALLS & HEARTBREAKERS (THE FIX WAS IN)

Bruce beating Sean by 0.5 points? HALF A POINT? That's not a victory, that's a STATISTICAL ERROR! The margin of victory is smaller than the margin of error on my breathalyzer test!

*[Laughing maniacally]*

You know what probably happened? Some stat correction at 11:59 PM when everyone's asleep! They probably gave Daniel Jones an extra rushing yard he got in HIGH SCHOOL! That's how they GET YA!

And Pete beating Matt by 2.5? That's the difference between ordering your turkey sandwich with mayo or mustard! IT'S NOTHING! Matt probably lost because his players were too busy doing TURKEY TROTS for charity! CHARITY! In MY day, we played through Thanksgiving! Both the holiday AND the emotion!

## LOOKING AHEAD (THROUGH BEER GOGGLES)

*[Swaying significantly, possibly holding onto table for support]*

Listen... *burp*... here's what's gonna happen...

Joe's Team is leading with 1116.5 points but Chris is RIGHT BEHIND HIM with 1100! That's closer than me and my third wife before the restraining order! It's gonna come down to the WIRE! Or the NFL is gonna decide who wins based on MARKET SHARE!

*[Voice dropping to conspiratorial whisper again]*

Bruce, Cal, and Sean are all hovering around 900 points... you know what that means? COLLUSION! They're probably gonna draw straws to see who makes the playoffs!

And at the bottom? Mitch with 721 points? That's not a season, that's a CRY FOR HELP! 

*[Suddenly shouting]*

THE PLAYOFFS ARE A SHAM ANYWAY! You know who's gonna win? Whoever Roger Goodell's bookie says should win! It's all predetermined like wrestling but with MORE STEROIDS!

## IN CONCLUSION (I THINK)

*[Attempting to stand on chair, reconsidering]*

Week 9 was... was... it was EXACTLY what THEY wanted you to see! Chris destroying Mike? PLANNED! Close games decided by half points? SCRIPTED! Injuries to star players? CONVENIENT!

You wanna know the REAL truth? Fantasy football is just a government experiment to see how much disappointment the average American can handle before they snap! And based on Mike and Eli's teams this week, the answer is: A LOT!

*[Raising beer can that may or may not be empty]*

So HERE'S to Week 9! The week that proved once and for all that NOTHING MAKES SENSE, the points are MADE UP, and the only thing real is my DISAPPOINTMENT in all of you for not seeing what's REALLY going on!

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go lie down in the guest room and think about why Jacoby Brissett outscored Lamar Jackson. That's not natural selection, that's ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE!

*[Stumbles away, muttering about Pete Rose and the forward pass]*

HAPPY THANKSGIVING, YOU SHEEP!
