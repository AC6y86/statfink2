# Week 12 Fantasy Football Recap: The Thankful and The Unthankful

*A Thanksgiving Eve Journey Through Gratitude and Grievance*

---

As we gather around our fantasy tables this Thanksgiving week, some owners are carving up victories like a perfectly roasted turkey, while others are left staring at the dry, overcooked remains of their playoff hopes. Week 12 delivered a feast for some and famine for others, and in the spirit of the season, let us count both our blessings and our lamentations.

---

## THE THANKFUL

### Joe - 138.0 Points (Victory over Aaron's Team, 64.5)

**What Joe is thankful for:** Where does one even begin? Joe's team put up the highest score of the week, a gluttonous 138.0-point feast that left Aaron's squad picking at scraps. Jalen Hurts delivered a 30-point Thanksgiving ham, running and throwing his way to fantasy glory. The support cast was equally bountiful: Wan'Dale Robinson contributed 20 points like that unexpected side dish everyone loves, James Cook and George Pickens each brought 17 points to the table, and even the backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett carved out 14 points. The Patriots defense added 8 points as the dessert course. Joe now sits at 10-2 alongside Chris at the top of the league standings, with 1,479.5 total points. This is what Thanksgiving looks like in fantasy football, friends. An embarrassment of riches.

**What Joe could be unthankful for:** Honestly? Nothing. When you score 138.0 points and obliterate your opponent by 73.5 points, you are too busy loosening your belt to complain. Jordan Mason and Rico Dowdle both posted zeroes on the bench, but when your starters feast like this, who cares about the bench warmers? Joe should send Jalen Hurts a thank you card. And maybe a pie.

---

### Cal - 124.5 Points (Victory over Bruce's Team, 63.0)

**What Cal is thankful for:** Jaxon Smith-Njigba put on an absolute show with 28 points, proving that sometimes the young receivers are the ones bringing the fire to the Thanksgiving table. Trevor Lawrence and Caleb Williams combined for 45 points from the quarterback position, giving Cal the dual-threat advantage that makes opponents weep into their mashed potatoes. Rookie sensation Ashton Jeanty added 14 points, and even Dylan Sampson contributed 11 points off the proverbial bench. The Steelers defense chipped in 8 points as the gravy on top. Cal improves to 7-5 with 1,275.5 total points, staying firmly in the playoff conversation.

**What Cal is unthankful for:** That tight end room is bleaker than a Thanksgiving dinner with estranged relatives. Tyler Warren and Kyle Pitts Sr. both posted zeros. Emeka Egbuka? Zero. The trio of goose eggs at those positions would normally sink a team, but when your wide receivers and quarterbacks are cooking like this, you can survive the disappointments elsewhere. Still, Cal might want to consider shopping for tight end help before the playoffs arrive.

---

### Matt - 101.5 Points (Victory over Eli's Team, 71.0)

**What Matt is thankful for:** The running back tandem of Derrick Henry and Christian McCaffrey delivered a combined 36 points like two perfectly cooked Thanksgiving entrees. The wide receiver corps of DJ Moore (19 points) and A.J. Brown (17 points) provided the necessary side dishes. Even Andy Borregales, a kicker most people have never heard of, contributed 9 points. Matt climbs to 8-4 with 1,065.5 points, securing one of the safer playoff positions. The victory margin of 30.5 points was comfortable enough that Matt could enjoy his victory meal without any heartburn.

**What Matt is unthankful for:** The bench. Oh, the bench. Jerome Ford, Rachaad White, Justice Hill, Rashid Shaheed, and Darius Slayton all posted zeros. That is five players contributing absolutely nothing, like relatives who show up to dinner empty-handed and then complain about the stuffing. Justice Hill is officially out with a neck injury, which at least provides an explanation. But the rest? No excuses. Matt won this week on the strength of his stars alone, and he should be thankful they showed up because the supporting cast was nowhere to be found.

---

### Mike - 98.5 Points (Victory over Sean's Team, 67.0)

**What Mike is thankful for:** Jahmyr Gibbs. That is it. That is the tweet. Gibbs absolutely demolished with 39 points, the single highest individual performance of Week 12. When one player scores nearly 40% of your team's points, you get on your knees and give thanks. Quinshon Judkins added a solid 16 points, Harrison Butker kicked his way to 10 points, and the Packers defense contributed another 10. Mike moves to 5-7 with 1,053.5 points, keeping mathematical playoff hopes alive purely through the blessing of having Jahmyr Gibbs on the roster.

**What Mike is unthankful for:** Everything else. Tee Higgins? Out with a concussion, zero points. Alvin Kamara? Zero. Jordan Love? Zero. Tyjae Spears? Zero. Romeo Doubs? Zero. Mason Taylor? Zero. That is six players posting bagels while Gibbs carried the entire team on his back like a running back carrying a turkey across a football field. Mike needs to light a candle for Gibbs' health because without him, this team would be in serious trouble.

---

### Chris - 79.5 Points (Victory over Mitch's Team, 53.0)

**What Chris is thankful for:** Dak Prescott returning from injury with 30 points was the Thanksgiving miracle Chris desperately needed. Sam Darnold added 16 points as the safety net, proving that hoarding quarterbacks can actually pay dividends. Rashee Rice contributed 11 points from the receiver position, and even Josh Allen managed 9 points in what appeared to be a committee approach to quarterback usage. Chris maintains first place at 10-2 with 1,488.5 total points, the highest in the league. The margin of victory was a comfortable 26.5 points.

**What Chris is unthankful for:** The production from everywhere except quarterback. Tony Pollard, Jameson Williams, and Jordan Addison all posted zeros. The Buccaneers defense contributed nothing. Tyler Allgeier and Alec Pierce? Goose eggs. Chris won this game almost entirely on quarterback play, which is both a blessing and a warning sign. If those quarterbacks ever falter, this roster has concerning depth issues. But hey, when you are 10-2 and leading the league in scoring, you can afford to worry about that later.

---

### Dan - 60.5 Points (Victory over Pete's Team, 54.0)

**What Dan is thankful for:** Surviving. Just surviving. In the closest matchup of the week, Dan squeaked out a 6.5-point victory in a game where neither team had much to brag about. Davante Adams delivered 19 points as the hero of this mediocre affair, and Geno Smith added 14 points. Khalil Shakir's 9 points and Brandon McManus' 7 kicking points provided just enough to push Dan over the finish line. Dan improves to 5-7 with 1,050.5 points, staying alive in the playoff hunt by the thinnest of margins.

**What Dan is unthankful for:** The rest of the roster. Saquon Barkley managed only 3 points. SAQUON BARKLEY. THREE POINTS. The man who was supposed to be the centerpiece of this offense delivered less than a modest appetizer. Kenneth Walker III also put up just 3 points. Zay Flowers: 3 points. Kyren Williams and Blake Corum both posted zeros. The Ravens and Browns defenses contributed nothing. Dan won this game not because his team was good, but because Pete's team was even more disappointing. Sometimes in fantasy football, you give thanks simply for your opponent having a worse day than you.

---

## THE UNTHANKFUL

### Aaron - 64.5 Points (Loss to Joe's Team, 138.0)

**What Aaron is unthankful for:** Everything. Absolutely everything. Getting walloped by 73.5 points is not just a loss, it is a public humiliation. Jayden Daniels and Kyler Murray both posted zeros at quarterback. Brian Thomas Jr. and Marvin Harrison Jr. combined for zero points from the wide receiver position. Tank Bigsby, Mark Andrews, Will Shipley, Zamir White, and Jaxson Dart all contributed absolutely nothing. That is nine players posting zeros. NINE. The highest scorers were Jakobi Meyers with 11 points and a collection of players barely reaching 8 points each. Aaron falls to 2-10 with 940.0 total points, officially eliminated from any meaningful playoff discussion.

**What Aaron could be thankful for:** The Cardinals defense managed 8 points. That is it. That is the only crumb of positivity from this disaster of a week. When your defense outscores most of your skill position players, you know you are living in dark times.

---

### Bruce - 63.0 Points (Loss to Cal's Team, 124.5)

**What Bruce is unthankful for:** Getting doubled up by your opponent is never fun, and Bruce's 63.0 points to Cal's 124.5 felt like showing up to Thanksgiving dinner with a store-bought pie while your host served a seven-course gourmet meal. Nick Chubb, Jerry Jeudy, Bhayshul Tuten, Marquise Brown, Kyle Juszczyk, and Van Jefferson all posted zeros. The Texans and Colts defenses contributed nothing. Ja'Marr Chase, Bo Nix, and Jaleel McLaughlin round out the zero-point contributors. Daniel Jones was the leading scorer with 16 points, which tells you everything you need to know about how this week went.

**What Bruce could be thankful for:** Brock Bowers is still rostered and will eventually have better weeks than this 3-point outing. Bruce falls to 6-6 with 1,137.5 points, right in the middle of the pack where every game feels like life or death. The playoff race is brutal, and performances like this make the path exponentially harder.

---

### Sean - 67.0 Points (Loss to Mike's Team, 98.5)

**What Sean is unthankful for:** Justin Jefferson posted zero points. Let that sink in. The player who should be the cornerstone of any fantasy team contributed nothing. Rhamondre Stevenson, Devin Singletary, Sterling Shepard, Justin Herbert, Jaylen Waddle, Rashod Bateman, Cameron Dicker, Quentin Johnston, Eddy Pineiro, and Kimani Vidal all added to the zero-point parade. When Cam Ward (22 points) and Travis Etienne Jr. (14 points) are your only lifelines, you are in trouble.

**What Sean could be thankful for:** At least he is not Aaron. Sean falls to 3-9 with 1,099.0 points, which means despite the terrible record, the team actually has decent scoring potential. Unfortunately, that potential has not translated to wins. Three wins heading into the final stretch of the season is a grim place to be.

---

### Pete - 54.0 Points (Loss to Dan's Team, 60.5)

**What Pete is unthankful for:** Losing by 6.5 points when you only scored 54.0 points total is the fantasy football equivalent of bringing undercooked turkey to Thanksgiving and then dropping it on the floor. D'Andre Swift, Ricky Pearsall, Ray Davis, Travis Kelce, Jake Browning, and Sean Tucker all posted zeros. Joe Burrow, Bucky Irving, Courtland Sutton, Brandon Aiyuk, and Zach Ertz added more zeros to the pile. Brandon Aiyuk remains out with a knee injury, providing at least some explanation, but the rest of the roster has no excuses.

**What Pete could be thankful for:** Matthew Stafford and Jared Goff combined for 43 points, which sounds impressive until you realize that was 80% of the team's production. Pete falls to 6-6 with 1,046.5 points, still in the playoff conversation but needing significant improvement to make a postseason run.

---

### Eli - 71.0 Points (Loss to Matt's Team, 101.5)

**What Eli is unthankful for:** The defending champion is struggling. Eli's 71.0 points to Matt's 101.5 represents another frustrating loss in what has become a season of frustration. David Montgomery, Joshua Palmer, T.J. Hockenson, Matthew Golden, Tua Tagovailoa, Joe Mixon, Wil Lutz, and Zavier Scott all contributed zero points. Joe Mixon is officially out with a foot/ankle injury, but the rest of the zeroes are harder to explain.

**What Eli could be thankful for:** Amon-Ra St. Brown delivered 17 points, proving he is still one of the elite receivers in fantasy. Patrick Mahomes added 14 points, and the supporting cast of Darnell Mooney (11 points), CeeDee Lamb (6 points), and Trey McBride (6 points) provided some production. Eli falls to 5-7 with 968.0 points, facing an uphill battle to defend last year's championship.

---

### Mitch - 53.0 Points (Loss to Chris's Team, 79.5)

**What Mitch is unthankful for:** The lowest score of the week. Fifty-three points in a fantasy matchup is the equivalent of showing up to Thanksgiving with just a bag of dinner rolls and expecting praise. Lamar Jackson, one of the premier quarterbacks in fantasy, posted zero points. Chuba Hubbard, Brian Robinson Jr., Cooper Kupp, Stefon Diggs, and Xavier Legette all added zeros. Michael Penix Jr. and Cam Skattebo are both on injured reserve, providing no help. The Vikings and Bears defenses contributed nothing.

**What Mitch could be thankful for:** Kareem Hunt managed 17 points, which at least showed one player cared about competing. Brock Purdy added 11 points, and the kickers Tyler Loop and Jake Bates combined for 13 points. George Kittle and Puka Nacua each contributed 6 points. But when your leading scorer is a running back with 17 points and your top-tier assets are all zeroing out, the Thanksgiving vibes are decidedly sour. Mitch falls to 5-7 with 945.5 points, needing a significant turnaround to salvage the season.

---

## THE WEEKLY BREAKDOWN

### The Feast Master
**Joe** with 138.0 points put on a performance worthy of the finest Thanksgiving feast. Multiple players in double digits, led by Jalen Hurts' 30-point masterpiece, made this the week's most dominant showing.

### The Close Call
**Dan vs. Pete** (60.5 to 54.0) was the nail-biter of the week. A 6.5-point margin in a game where both teams struggled to find offensive production. Dan should send a thank you card to Davante Adams for bailing him out.

### The Bust Brigade
The list of disappointing stars this week reads like a who's who of fantasy football royalty: Lamar Jackson (0), Justin Jefferson (0), Saquon Barkley (3), Travis Kelce (0), Ja'Marr Chase (0), and Jayden Daniels (0). These are the players that get drafted in the first rounds, and they collectively delivered almost nothing. Owners across the league are justified in their lack of gratitude.

### The Gibbs Show
Jahmyr Gibbs' 39-point explosion deserves special recognition. In a week of widespread disappointment, Gibbs stood alone as the brightest star, carrying Mike's team to victory almost single-handedly.

## LOOKING AHEAD

With only a few weeks remaining in the regular season, the playoff picture is becoming clearer. Chris and Joe sit atop the standings at 10-2, having secured comfortable positions for the postseason. Matt's 8-4 record provides a solid buffer. The real drama exists in the middle of the pack, where Cal (7-5), Bruce (6-6), Pete (6-6), Mike (5-7), Dan (5-7), Eli (5-7), and Mitch (5-7) are all fighting for the remaining playoff spots.

Aaron (2-10) and Sean (3-9) can start focusing on next year's draft strategy, as their playoff hopes have effectively ended. For everyone else, every game from here on out is a must-win situation.
