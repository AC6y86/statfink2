# WEEK 11 FANTASY FOOTBALL RECAP: TURKEYS, STUFFING & BLOWOUTS

## A THANKSGIVING FEAST OF FANTASY FOOTBALL DISASTERS AND UNEXPECTED DELIGHTS

*Grab your stretchy pants and loosen that belt, folks, because Week 11 served up a full Thanksgiving spread of fantasy football madness. We had turkeys gobbling up roster spots for nothing, stuffing galore in some garbage-time stat padding, and enough gravy to drown a small village worth of lucky winners. The aroma of victory and the stench of defeat both hung heavy in the air this week. Let's carve into this bird and see what the fantasy gods delivered to our plates.*

Pull up a barstool, order yourself something strong, and prepare for the full rundown of who's eating like kings and who's getting the crusty end piece of the fantasy football bread loaf. This week saw Chris absolutely demolish Eli in what can only be described as a culinary massacre, while Cal survived a spirited upset attempt from Dan. The playoff picture is taking shape, and let me tell you, some of these teams are already looking like day-old leftovers.

## THE HEADLINER: CHRIS CARVES UP THE COMPETITION

**Chris's Team 155.0 - Eli's Team 79.0**

Ladies and gentlemen, witness what happens when you invite Josh Allen to your fantasy Thanksgiving dinner. The Buffalo Bills quarterback didn't just show up; he brought his own carving set and went absolutely POSTAL on everyone's expectations. Allen dropped an obscene 48.0 fantasy points, accounting for nearly a third of Chris's total output by himself. We're talking 317 passing yards, 3 passing touchdowns, 40 rushing yards, and 3 RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS. The man was playing backyard football while everyone else was still setting up the folding tables.

But wait, Chris wasn't done piling on the mashed potatoes. Dak Prescott decided he wanted some spotlight too, contributing 29.0 points with 268 yards and 4 touchdowns through the air. TreVeyon Henderson chipped in 27.0 points with a multi-faceted performance (62 rushing yards, 2 rushing TDs, 31 receiving yards, and a receiving TD). This is what we in the business call "stacking your plate so high that it becomes structurally unsound." Chris scored 155.0 points - the highest total of the week by a COUNTRY MILE - while poor Eli was left staring at his 79.0-point effort wondering where it all went wrong.

As for Eli, this was a turkey of historic proportions. Half his roster was serving up goose eggs like it was their job. Amon-Ra St. Brown? ZERO. David Montgomery? GOOSE EGG. Tua Tagovailoa, T.J. Hockenson, Darnell Mooney, Joshua Palmer, and Matthew Golden all combined for exactly NOTHING. Kenneth Gainwell tried to salvage the meal with 22.0 points, and Trey McBride added 17.0, but when seven of your players combine for zero points, you're not eating turkey - you ARE the turkey. Chris extends his league-best record to 9-2 while Eli drops to 5-6 and needs to start making some changes at the buffet line.

## MATCHUP BREAKDOWNS: WHERE DREAMS GO TO DIE

### THE CLOSEST CALL: Cal's Team 109.5 - Dan's Team 98.0

*The Margin: 11.5 points*

Now THIS was the nail-biter of the week, the game that had everyone at the sports bar leaning forward in their seats. Cal came into this matchup needing a win to keep pace with the playoff contenders, and Dan was looking to play spoiler. For three-quarters of the games, this one could have gone either way.

Cal's feast was anchored by the always-reliable Bijan Robinson, who rumbled for 104 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns to rack up 25.0 fantasy points. The Atlanta workhorse added 39 receiving yards on 4 catches for good measure. Trevor Lawrence added 13.0 points, Drake London and Jaxon Smith-Njigba each contributed 9.0 points, and Tyrone Tracy Jr. matched them. Cal's defense also chipped in 16.0 points to push the total over the century mark. It wasn't a dominant performance, but it was ENOUGH.

Dan, meanwhile, had one of those maddening "almost" weeks. Kyren Williams led the way with 14.0 points, and Dan had solid contributions from Kenneth Walker III (11.0), Deebo Samuel (11.0), Geno Smith (11.0), and Marcus Mariota (11.0). The problem? Too many guys in the 5-8 point range and zero production from Blake Corum, Khalil Shakir, and Raheem Mostert. Dan scored 98.0 points, which is respectable, but Cal's 109.5 was just enough to slam the door. Cal improves to 6-5 while Dan falls to 4-7 and is officially on the outside looking in at the playoff picture. Pour one out for Dan's postseason dreams.

### THE MITCH & SEAN SHOWDOWN: Mitch's Team 93.0 - Sean's Team 76.0

*The Margin: 17.0 points*

Mitch desperately needed this win, and boy did his San Francisco stack deliver the goods. Brock Purdy and George Kittle combined for 40.0 points on their own, with Purdy slinging 200 yards and 3 touchdowns for 21.0 points while Kittle hauled in 6 catches for 67 yards and 2 touchdowns for 19.0 points. That's what we call GETTING YOUR GRAVY FROM THE SAME SOURCE, folks. When your QB and TE are both from the same team and both go off, you're basically double-dipping in the mashed potatoes and nobody can stop you.

Xavier Legette added 14.0 points, and Kareem Hunt contributed 11.0 more. Even with Chuba Hubbard, Brian Robinson Jr., and Cooper Kupp all posting bagels, Mitch had enough to cruise. The supporting cast of Stefon Diggs (9.0) and Lamar Jackson (6.0) rounded out a solid team effort.

Sean, on the other hand, got a decent showing from Travis Etienne Jr. (19.0 points with 73 rushing yards and 2 TDs) and Devin Singletary (16.0), but the rest of the roster looked like someone left it in the oven too long. Justin Herbert posted a big fat ZERO. Justin Jefferson - the Justin Jefferson! - managed only 3.0 points. Breece Hall and Jaylen Waddle also combined for just 6.0 points. When your best players are your RB2s and your studs are no-shows, you're going to have a bad time. Mitch moves to 5-6 while Sean drops to 3-8 and should probably start thinking about next season.

### THE COMEBACK KID: Matt's Team 94.0 - Bruce's Team 67.5

*The Margin: 26.5 points*

Matt came into this game as the underdog against Bruce's squad, but his Carolina Panthers connection had other plans. Bryce Young - yes, THAT Bryce Young, the guy everyone was ready to bury after last season - threw for a whopping 448 yards and 3 touchdowns without a single interception, good for 32.0 fantasy points. This is the definition of STUFFING YOUR STATS, my friends. Garbage time or not, those points count all the same.

Christian McCaffrey was vintage CMC, rushing for 81 yards and 2 touchdowns while adding 40 receiving yards and another touchdown through the air for 30.0 total points. Derrick Henry contributed 17.0 more. When your top three players combine for 79.0 points, you can survive having A.J. Brown, DJ Moore, DeVonta Smith, and Jerome Ford all goose-egging you. Matt's 94.0 points represented a solid week, especially considering those zeros.

Bruce, meanwhile, had one of those weeks where nothing clicked. His leading scorer was Drake Maye with just 14.0 points. The next best? Bhayshul Tuten with 11.0 points. That's your top two. Ja'Marr Chase, DK Metcalf, Calvin Ridley (on IR), Nick Chubb, and Jerry Jeudy all combined for ZERO. When your superstar receiver puts up a donut, you know the fantasy gods have abandoned you. Bruce drops this one but stays at 6-5, still in playoff contention. Matt improves to 7-4 and continues to lurk in the hunt.

### JOE STAYS ROLLING: Joe's Team 91.0 - Mike's Team 65.5

*The Margin: 25.5 points*

Joe needed a win to stay tied atop the standings with Chris, and his crew delivered with a workmanlike effort. Jacoby Brissett - starting for the Cardinals after Kyler Murray went down - was the unexpected hero, throwing for 452 yards and 2 touchdowns (with 2 picks, but whatever) for 25.0 points. When your waiver wire pickup is your leading scorer, that's what we call GRAVY, baby. Pure, unexpected gravy.

George Pickens continued his resurgence with 144 receiving yards and a touchdown for 17.0 points, while Justin Fields added 16.0 as a dual-threat contributor. James Cook III chipped in 11.0, and the supporting cast did just enough to push Joe over 90. The zeros from Ladd McConkey, Xavier Worthy, Christian Kirk, Wan'Dale Robinson, Dallas Goedert, and Cade Otton were concerning, but when you've got 91.0 from your active players, you take the W and move on.

Mike's squad just couldn't find the end zone consistently. Baker Mayfield led with 13.0 points, Jordan Love added 12.0, and Tee Higgins contributed 11.0 (he's listed as Out with a concussion, so those must be previous stats carrying over). Jahmyr Gibbs only managed 9.0 points, which is a turkey performance from someone who was supposed to be a league-winner. Mike falls to 4-7 and is mathematically alive for the playoffs, but practically speaking, he's toast. Joe stays at 9-2, tied with Chris for the league lead.

### PETE SURVIVES: Pete's Team 98.0 - Aaron's Team 60.0

*The Margin: 38.0 points*

Sometimes you don't have to be great; you just have to be better than the other guy. Pete's 98.0 points were solid, but the real story here is Aaron's dismal 60.0-point effort - the second-lowest score of the week. When your opponent is serving up a burnt turkey, even a mediocre performance looks like a five-star Michelin meal.

Sean Tucker was Pete's Thanksgiving MVP, absolutely exploding for 106 rushing yards, 2 rushing touchdowns, 34 receiving yards, and a receiving touchdown for a massive 33.0 points. That's a stat line that would make any fantasy manager weep tears of joy. Nico Collins added 14.0, Jared Goff contributed 14.0, and Travis Kelce matched with 14.0 of his own. Matthew Stafford's 10.0 rounded out the productive players. Pete didn't need much else with Tucker going nuclear.

Aaron, though? Woof. This was a TURKEY in every sense of the word. Tetairoa McMillan was the lone bright spot with 25.0 points (130 yards, 2 TDs, 8 receptions), but after him it was a barren wasteland. Mark Andrews and Bam Knight each managed 8.0, and then it was single digits and zeros as far as the eye could see. Zach Charbonnet and Tank Bigsby both posted goose eggs. When your roster's second-best player is a tight end with 8.0 points, you're not competing - you're just showing up to lose. Aaron falls to 2-9 and should officially start scouting for next year's draft. Pete improves to 6-5 and remains in the thick of the playoff race.

## PERFORMANCE TIERS: THE THANKSGIVING TABLE SEATING CHART

**The Head of the Table (Elite Tier - 90+ Points)**
- Chris's Team: 155.0 (Josh Allen went BERSERK)
- Cal's Team: 109.5 (Bijan Robinson carried the load)
- Pete's Team: 98.0 (Sean Tucker breakout game)
- Dan's Team: 98.0 (Solid but not enough)
- Matt's Team: 94.0 (Bryce Young revenge tour)
- Mitch's Team: 93.0 (49ers stack paid dividends)
- Joe's Team: 91.0 (Brissett to the rescue)

**The Kids' Table (Below Average - Sub-80 Points)**
- Eli's Team: 79.0 (Half the roster was MIA)
- Sean's Team: 76.0 (Stars failed to show up)
- Bruce's Team: 67.5 (Chase and Metcalf goose eggs)
- Mike's Team: 65.5 (Nothing worked)
- Aaron's Team: 60.0 (McMillan or bust... and it was bust)

The gap between the top tier and the bottom is MASSIVE this week. Chris outscored Aaron by nearly 100 points. That's not a matchup; that's a crime scene.

## THE BUST BRIGADE: WHO SERVED UP BURNT TURKEY?

- **Ja'Marr Chase (Bruce's Team)**: The superstar receiver posted a big fat ZERO. When you're paying premium draft capital for Chase, you expect more than an empty plate.
- **Justin Jefferson (Sean's Team)**: 3.0 points from the guy who's supposed to be a top-3 receiver in fantasy? That's not a turkey; that's a complete waste of a roster spot this week.
- **Amon-Ra St. Brown (Eli's Team)**: ZERO points. The Sun God didn't even show up for the Thanksgiving parade.
- **Josh Jacobs (Chris's Team)**: Goose egg for the Packers' lead back. Good thing Chris didn't need him.
- **David Montgomery (Eli's Team)**: Another zero for Eli. The Lions RB room was a complete disaster.

## THE GRAVY: LUCKY WINS AND FLUKY OUTCOMES

Chris didn't need any luck with Josh Allen dropping 48, but getting 29 from Dak and 27 from Henderson when half his bench posted zeros? That's pure, unadulterated GRAVY. Matt got some gravy too - riding Bryce Young's 448-yard day to victory despite having A.J. Brown, DJ Moore, and DeVonta Smith all out or posting zeros.

## STANDINGS CHECK: WHO'S EATING WELL?

| Rank | Team | Owner | Record | Total Points |
|------|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Chris's Team | Chris | 9-2 | 1409.0 |
| 2 | Joe's Team | Joe | 9-2 | 1341.5 |
| 3 | Matt's Team | Matt | 7-4 | 964.0 |
| 4 | Pete's Team | Pete | 6-5 | 992.5 |
| 5 | Cal's Team | Cal | 6-5 | 1151.0 |
| 6 | Bruce's Team | Bruce | 6-5 | 1074.5 |
| 7 | Mitch's Team | Mitch | 5-6 | 892.5 |
| 8 | Eli's Team | Eli | 5-6 | 897.0 |
| 9 | Dan's Team | Dan | 4-7 | 990.0 |
| 10 | Mike's Team | Mike | 4-7 | 955.0 |
| 11 | Sean's Team | Sean | 3-8 | 1032.0 |
| 12 | Aaron's Team | Aaron | 2-9 | 875.5 |

## LOOKING AHEAD: PLAYOFF IMPLICATIONS

Chris and Joe are sitting pretty at 9-2, but don't sleep on Matt at 7-4. The logjam at 6-5 (Pete, Cal, Bruce) means every win matters from here on out. Mitch and Eli at 5-6 are on the bubble, while Dan and Mike at 4-7 need to essentially run the table. Sean and Aaron? Start planning for next year's draft, my friends.

The Week 11 averages clocked in at around 90.5 points per team, meaning anyone below that number is underperforming. Chris's 155.0 was a full 64 points above average - that's the kind of dominance that sends shockwaves through the league.

## FINAL THOUGHTS

Week 11 gave us everything we could want from a pre-Thanksgiving fantasy slate: a 155-point explosion from Chris, multiple blowouts, a few close calls, and enough turkeys to feed an entire NFL stadium. Josh Allen reminded everyone why he was a first-round pick, Bryce Young showed signs of life, and Sean Tucker emerged as a must-start option going forward.

As we head into the actual Thanksgiving week, remember: just like that one uncle who always drinks too much and starts arguments about politics, fantasy football will find a way to disappoint you when you least expect it. Stay vigilant, check those injury reports, and may your turkeys be golden and your stuffing be plentiful.

Happy Thanksgiving, and may your fantasy points be ever in your favor!
