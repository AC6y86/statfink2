## Scene I: In Which We Set the Stage Most Dramatically (And Then Abandon It Entirely)

*[A medieval castle. Thunder. Lightning. Very, very frightening. NARRATOR enters, trips over a football, recovers with dignity]*

**NARRATOR:** Right! What's all this then? Week 11 of the fantasy football season, and already the peasants are revolting! Though to be fair, they've always been rather revolting, haven't they? Especially Eli's team, sitting there with a measly 79 points like some sort of mathematical tragedy performed by particularly depressed accountants.

But I digress! *[turns to camera]* Oh, hello there. Didn't see you come in. Welcome to this week's fantasy football recap, brought to you by the Knights Who Say "Ni!" and the number 155, which, coincidentally, is exactly how many points Chris scored this week before we remembered that defensive bonuses aren't actually made of cheese.

*[A knight in full armor walks by carrying a laptop]*

**KNIGHT:** 'Tis but a flesh wound!

**NARRATOR:** That's not even relevant to fantasy football!

**KNIGHT:** Neither is this entire framing device, yet here we are!

And so, dear viewers, we begin our tale of twelve brave souls, each commanding an army of exactly nineteen players - no more, no less. Twenty would be absurd, and eighteen is right out! These warriors of the waiver wire, these gladiators of the gridiron, these... oh, who are we kidding? They're just blokes sitting on their sofas refreshing their phones every thirty seconds like demented hamsters pressing the dopamine button.

## Scene II: The Tale of Sir Chris and the Holy Grail of 155 Points

*[Trumpets sound. A coconut horse gallops across the screen. It's actually just Bruce making clip-clop sounds with two halves of a coconut while reading injury reports]*

Lo and behold! From the mists of mediocrity emerged Sir Chris, wielding the mighty Josh Allen like Excalibur itself! Forty-eight points! FORTY-EIGHT! That's more points than there are varieties of cheese in France! (Editor's note: This is factually incorrect, but we're committed to the bit now.)

"But how," you cry, your voice echoing across the vast emptiness of your mother's basement, "how did Chris achieve such magnificent heights?" Well, I'll tell you, though frankly you could have just looked at the bloody scoreboard yourself, couldn't you? Josh Allen threw touchdowns like a medieval trebuchet launching diseased cattle over castle walls - effective, devastating, and slightly concerning from a public health perspective.

But wait! There's more! Like a late-night infomercial for pointy sticks, Chris also deployed Dak Prescott for 29 points, because apparently having one elite quarterback isn't enough when you're compensating for something. And let's not forget TreVeyon Henderson with 27 points, running through defenses like the Spanish Inquisition - nobody expected him! Though unlike the Spanish Inquisition, he actually showed up when scheduled.

Yet even in triumph, tragedy lurked. Josh Jacobs, Tony Pollard, and RJ Harvey combined for a spectacular zero points, proving once again that fantasy football is just astrology for men who think they understand statistics. Chris's team scored 155 net points after defensive adjustments, crushing poor Eli's dreams like... like... oh, I don't know, like something very crushable. A biscuit, perhaps. A very sad, underperforming biscuit.

## Scene III: The Dreaded Matchup of Doom (Mitch vs Sean: A Tragedy in Three Acts)

*[Enter two PEASANTS, looking confused]*

**PEASANT 1:** I heard Mitch scored 93 points!

**PEASANT 2:** And Sean scored 76!

**PEASANT 1:** That's not very many, is it?

**PEASANT 2:** Well, it's more than the number of shrubberies in this entire production.

**NARRATOR:** Ah yes, the battle of the "We're Not Dead Yet" brigade! Mitch, armed with Brock Purdy's modest 21 points (about as exciting as watching paint dry on a particularly humid Tuesday), somehow emerged victorious over Sean's even more pathetic 76-point effort. It was like watching two elderly knights duel with pool noodles - technically combat, but nobody's really getting hurt, are they?

The true tragedy? Mitch started Chuba Hubbard, Brian Robinson Jr., AND Cooper Kupp - all of whom scored precisely nil, zero, zilch, nada, nothing! It's like he actively tried to lose but couldn't quite manage it because Sean was trying even harder! Meanwhile, Michael Penix Jr. sits on Mitch's injured reserve with a torn ACL, which is somehow still more functional than his active roster decisions.

Cam Skattebo? Also on IR. Terry McLaurin? Out. It's like Mitch's roster is performing Monty Python's Dead Parrot sketch, except instead of a Norwegian Blue, it's his entire receiving corps! "This team is no more! It has ceased to be! It's expired and gone to meet its maker! This is a late team! It's a stiff! Bereft of life, it rests in peace!"

But somehow, SOMEHOW, Sean managed to be worse. It's rather impressive, really, like failing a test when all the answers are written on the board. Sean's team mustered 76 net points, which in fantasy football terms is about as impressive as claiming you've discovered the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow but forgetting to specify African or European.

## Scene IV: The Middling Middle (Where Dreams Go to Die But Not Quite Completely)

*[A HISTORIAN appears, immediately gets eaten by a rabbit. Another HISTORIAN takes his place]*

**HISTORIAN:** In the middle tier, we find several teams trapped in fantasy purgatory, not quite good enough to win, not quite bad enough to get sympathy points.

Dan's Team faced Cal's Team in what historians will surely ignore completely! Cal emerged victorious with 109.5 points, thanks largely to Bijan Robinson's 25 points. Bijan ran through Dan's defense like King Arthur through the "Bring Out Your Dead" scene - purposefully and with great dignity, despite the absurdity surrounding him.

But Cal's victory was pyrrhic at best! Ashton Jeanty, Emeka Egbuka, and Dylan Sampson - his supposed "depth" - combined for zero points. ZERO! That's the same number of times this recap has made actual sense! It's like having a sword that's very sharp on one end but the other end is made of pudding. Chocolate pudding, granted, but pudding nonetheless.

Dan, meanwhile, scored a respectable 98 points, which in any other matchup might have been enough. But this is fantasy football, where "might have been" is the official motto, right after "Why did I start him?" and "The projections said he'd score 15!"

**Pete the Victorious** crushed Aaron 98-60 in what can only be described as a massacre. Well, it could be described other ways - "a drubbing," "a thorough beating," "Tuesday" - but massacre sounds more dramatic, doesn't it? Sean Tucker exploded for 33 points like the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch - "One... two... FIVE!" "Three, sir!" "THREE!" Aaron's team, crippled by Jayden Daniels being out, Kyler Murray on IR, and Marvin Harrison Jr. also out, looked like the Black Knight after all his limbs were removed - still talking a big game but fundamentally unable to do anything useful.

## Scene V: The Bottom Feeders (A Song of Ice and Dire)

*[Enter a MINSTREL, who immediately begins singing off-key]*

**MINSTREL:** 🎵 Brave Sir Bruce ran away! (No!)
Bravely ran away, away! (I didn't!)
When Joe scored 91 points that day,
Sir Bruce's 67.5 bravely ran away! 🎵

**BRUCE:** I never! I was tactically regrouping!

**NARRATOR:** Ah, the basement dwellers! Like the serfs of old, they toil endlessly for little reward, their suffering legendary, their points... not so much. Bruce managed only 67.5 points, with Calvin Ridley on injured reserve, presumably faking death to avoid being associated with this roster. It's rather like the Plague, but instead of killing you, it just makes your fantasy team profoundly disappointing.

Mike's 65.5 points against Joe's 91 was less a matchup and more a mercy killing. Joe, blessed with Jacoby Brissett's surprising 25 points (who knew Arizona's backup QB situation would be fantasy relevant? Literally no one. Not even Jacoby's mother), dispatched Mike with the efficiency of the French taunting King Arthur from their castle walls. "Your mother was a hamster, and your fantasy team smells of elderberries!"

But the true basement dweller? Aaron with his 60 points. SIXTY! That's barely more than the number of times this recap has broken the fourth wall! *[looks at camera]* Make that sixty-one. His roster looked like it was assembled by someone who's never actually watched football but heard it was "quite popular with the lads."

## Scene VI: The Matt and Bruce Affair (Or: How to Win With 94 Points)

*[Two GUARDS stand at a bridge]*

**GUARD 1:** What is your name?

**MATT:** Matt of the Ninety-Four Points!

**GUARD 1:** What is your quest?

**MATT:** To somehow defeat Bruce despite having C.J. Stroud out!

**GUARD 1:** What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen Christian McCaffrey?

**MATT:** European or African? Wait, that doesn't... he scored 30 points, does that help?

Indeed, Matt's 94 points defeated Bruce's pathetic 67.5 in what can only be described as "technically a victory." Bryce Young, the quarterback everyone forgot existed until he scored 32 points, combined with Christian McCaffrey's 30 to carry Matt's team like two swallows carrying a coconut. Could they do it? Apparently yes, though it defies all logic and several laws of physics.

Bruce, meanwhile, started players who performed about as well as the French government in 1940 - present but not particularly effective. The ghost of Calvin Ridley haunts his IR spot, a constant reminder that some wounds never heal, especially when they're listed as "fibula - Injured Reserve" in your lineup.

## Intermission: A Word From Our Sponsor

*[A MERCHANT appears]*

**MERCHANT:** This recap is brought to you by "Dennis Moore's Waiver Wire Lupins" - When you absolutely, positively need to pick up a player who will score zero points! "Stand and deliver! Your playoff hopes or your life!" Both? "Both is good."

---

## Scene VII: Performance Tier Analysis (Or: The Parting of the Competent from the Incompetent Sea)

**THE TIER OF EXCELLENCE** (The Knights of Ni!):
- Chris (155 points) - "We are the keepers of the sacred words: Ni, Peng, and Neee-wom! Also, Josh Allen is really good!"

**THE TIER OF ADEQUACY** (The Knights Who Say Ekke Ekke Ekke Ekke Ptangya Zoooooooom Boing!):
- Cal (109.5 points) - Formerly the Knights of Ni, but got a better offer
- Dan (98 points) - Trying their best, bless them
- Pete (98 points) - Identical to Dan but technically different

**THE TIER OF MEDIOCRITY** (The Village Idiots):
- Matt (94 points) - The best of the worst, like being the tallest dwarf
- Mitch (93 points) - Somehow won despite himself
- Joe (91 points) - Adequate, like room-temperature tea

**THE TIER OF DESPAIR** (The Dead Collectors):
- Eli (79 points) - "Bring out your dead!" "But I'm not dead yet!" "You will be soon!"
- Sean (76 points) - Actually might be dead
- Bruce (67.5 points) - Definitely dead
- Mike (65.5 points) - So dead they're starting to smell
- Aaron (60 points) - Deader than the parrot in the pet shop sketch

The gap between Chris's 155 and Aaron's 60? Ninety-five points! That's more than some teams scored total! It's like comparing the Holy Grail to a paper cup from Tesco - technically they both hold liquid, but one's going to get you a lot more respect at the Round Table.

---

## Scene VIII: The Magnificent Bust Brigade (A Lament in D Minor)

*[A MOURNER enters, wailing dramatically]*

**MOURNER:** Weep! Weep for the fallen! Those who were projected to score many points but instead scored none!

Let us observe a moment of silence for the dearly departed:

- **Amon-Ra St. Brown** (Eli's team) - 0 points. The Sun God dimmed to the brightness of a broken nightlight.
- **David Montgomery** (Eli's team) - 0 points. Ran straight into the void and never returned.
- **Tua Tagovailoa** (Eli's team) - 0 points. His performance was so bad, he made backup quarterbacks look elite.
- **Cooper Kupp** (Mitch's team) - 0 points. Once a prince, now a pauper, now nothing at all.

It's like these players attended the Monty Python School of Football, where the first rule is "Always look on the bright side of life" and the second rule is "Don't actually score any points because that would ruin the joke."

---

## Scene IX: The Injury Report (Or: Bring Out Your Dead!)

*[A CART rolls through, ringing a bell]*

**DEAD COLLECTOR:** Bring out your dead! Bring out your dead!

**The Following Players Are Deceased (Temporarily)**:

**OUT:**
- Jayden Daniels (Aaron) - "I'm not dead!" "You will be soon enough!"
- Marvin Harrison Jr. (Aaron) - Appendix removed, points also removed
- Joe Mixon (Eli) - Foot/ankle, existence questionable
- C.J. Stroud (Matt) - Concussion protocol, or as we call it, "The Ministry of Silly Walks"
- Terry McLaurin (Mitch) - Status: Missing, presumed unproductive
- Brandon Aiyuk (Pete) - Week-to-week, which in coach speak means "probably dead"

**INJURED RESERVE (Properly Dead):**
- Kyler Murray (Aaron) - Mid-foot sprain, career questionable
- Calvin Ridley (Bruce) - Fibula, placed on IR, dreams shattered
- Cam Skattebo (Mitch) - Ankle, Giants' IR, hope abandoned
- Michael Penix Jr. (Mitch) - ACL torn, surgery required, season over
- Sam LaPorta (Pete) - Back injury, Lions' IR, fantasy relevance expired

It's like a Shakespearean tragedy, except instead of everyone dying at the end, they're all just questionable for next week with lower body injuries. "To play, or not to play, that is the question tag!"

---

## Scene X: Close Calls and Heartbreaks (The Bridge of Death)

**BRIDGEKEEPER:** Stop! What... is your fantasy score?

**MITCH:** 93!

**BRIDGEKEEPER:** What... is your opponent's score?

**MITCH:** 76!

**BRIDGEKEEPER:** What... is the average points per game for a team starting three players who scored zero?

**MITCH:** I... I don't know that!

*[MITCH is not cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril because he somehow won anyway]*

The closest matchup of the week was actually Joe (91) defeating Mike (65.5), which isn't close at all, but when everyone's terrible, even mediocrity looks like excellence. It's rather like being the best singer in a choir of tone-deaf badgers - technically impressive but still painful to witness.

---

## Scene XI: Looking Ahead (The Soothsayer's Prophecy)

*[A SOOTHSAYER enters, looking mystical and slightly confused]*

**SOOTHSAYER:** I see... I see... the future! Week 12 approaches like a killer rabbit - small, seemingly harmless, but capable of destroying everything you hold dear!

Chris, riding high on 155 points, must now face the cruel mistress of regression to the mean! Will Josh Allen continue his aerial assault, or will he remember he plays for Buffalo and it's almost December? The bones say... something. They're not very specific bones.

Eli, in the dungeon of despair with 79 points, faces a critical question: How many players can one roster have injured before it's technically not even a team anymore? Is it like the Ship of Theseus, but with more ACL tears?

The playoff picture grows clearer, which is to say it's about as clear as British weather - you can see something's happening, but you're not quite sure what, and you definitely should have brought an umbrella. Chris leads the charge toward glory, while Aaron, Mike, and Bruce form a coalition of the mathematically eliminated, united in their shared misery and their group text titled "There's Always Next Year."

---

## Scene XII: The Cheesy Philosophical Ending

*[The entire CAST assembles on stage]*

**ALL:** 🎵 Always look on the bright side of life! *whistle* 🎵

**NARRATOR:** And so ends another week in the grand theatre of fantasy football, where the points are made up and the projections don't matter! Where grown adults argue about whether to start someone named "Tetairoa" or "TreVeyon" with the passion normally reserved for medieval land disputes!

Remember, dear fantasy managers: Life is quite absurd, and death's the final word. But until then, we have fantasy football, where every Sunday brings fresh disappointment and the eternal hope that THIS week, finally, all your players will actually play and score points!

Chris stands atop the mountain with 155 points, but as we've learned from the Holy Grail, sometimes the journey is more important than the destination. Unless the journey involves starting three players who score zero points like Mitch did, in which case the destination better be bloody spectacular.

**NARRATOR:** *[To camera]* And now for something completely different... Week 12! Same nonsense, different players on injured reserve!

*[Everyone exits, pursued by a bear. The bear is also on injured reserve.]*

**THE END**

*P.S. - The airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow is 20.1 miles per hour. African or European? African swallows are non-migratory. This has nothing to do with fantasy football, but neither did half of this recap, so there we are.*
