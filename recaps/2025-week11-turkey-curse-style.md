# THE TURKEY CURSE CHRONICLES: Week 11

## *An Ancient Fowl Evil Stalks Our League*

---

### THE CURSE DESCENDS

*The candles flicker. The temperature drops. Somewhere in the distance, a lone turkey gobbles ominously.*

Gather round, league members, for I must speak of a terrible darkness that has haunted our fantasy kingdom since the very first week of the 2025 season. The Turkey Curse--that ancient, merciless hex that attaches itself to the lowest scorer each week--has claimed yet another victim. And as the calendar creeps ever closer to Thanksgiving, its power grows stronger. Much, much stronger.

This week, the curse found a new host. Aaron's Team, once a proud franchise, now bears the mark of the gobbling doom with a catastrophic 60.0-point performance. The lowest score of Week 11. The curse has spoken. Aaron now carries the weight of ages--the very same weight that has crushed the dreams of so many before him.

But first, let us examine the carnage this fowl presence has wrought upon our league, and trace its terrible path through history.

### THE CURSE'S DARK HISTORY: A Timeline of Terror

The ancient scrolls (and by scrolls, I mean the ESPN database) reveal a horrifying pattern. Behold the curse's path of destruction:

| Week | Cursed Vessel | Points | The Horror |
|------|---------------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Eli's Team | 63.0 | The Original Sacrifice |
| 2 | Sean's Team | 77.0 | Passed Through Contact |
| 3 | Aaron's Team | 54.5 | First Claiming of Aaron |
| 4 | Aaron's Team | 77.0 | It Refused to Leave! |
| 5 | Mitch's Team | 58.5 | The Curse Spreads |
| 6 | Mike's Team | 50.0 | Rock Bottom |
| 7 | Mitch's Team | 59.5 | The Double-Dipped Damned |
| 8 | Cal's Team | 20.0 | THE LEGENDARY DISASTER |
| 9 | Eli's Team | 63.5 | Return of the Original Host |
| 10 | Matt's Team | 49.5 | Fresh Victim |
| 11 | Aaron's Team | 60.0 | THE THIRD CLAIMING |

**ANALYSIS OF THE DARK PATTERN:** Aaron has been claimed by the Turkey Curse THREE TIMES this season. Three! This is unprecedented in recorded fantasy history. Either Aaron has deeply offended the ancient poultry gods, or he has become a vessel for something far more sinister. The curse appears to FAVOR him. It returns to him like a loyal, terrible pet.

### THE WEEK'S CHAMPION: Chris's Team Defies the Darkness

While curses swirl and owners tremble, one team stood defiant against the supernatural chaos. Chris's Team erupted for an absolutely monstrous **155.0 points**, the highest score of Week 11 by a country mile. The curse cannot touch those who score this high--it recoils from such power like a vampire from holy water.

Josh Allen was the primary source of this protective magic, conjuring **48.0 fantasy points** from the ether. This was not merely a good game--this was a summoning ritual of pure fantasy excellence. Allen threw for touchdowns, ran for touchdowns, and generally made opposing defenses question their life choices.

But Chris was not content with one hero. Dak Prescott contributed **29.0 points** in a move that many experts believe represents a blood pact with football deities. TreVeyon Henderson added **27.0 points**, and Jameson Williams chipped in **14.0 more**. When your backup contributors are outscoring entire opposing lineups, you know you've found temporary sanctuary from the Turkey Curse.

Chris now sits atop the league standings at 9-2, watching from his fortress of 1,409.0 cumulative points as lesser mortals scramble below.

### MATCHUP BREAKDOWNS: Tales of Triumph and Tragedy

#### **The Absolute Demolition: Chris's Team (155.0) vs. Eli's Team (79.0)**

Eli made a critical error this week: he showed up to play fantasy football. Against the Josh Allen Apocalypse, what could any mere mortal do? Kenneth Gainwell tried his best with **22.0 points**, and Trey McBride contributed a respectable **17.0 points**, but these efforts were like throwing pebbles at an avalanche.

Patrick Mahomes--yes, THAT Patrick Mahomes--managed only **14.0 points** on Eli's roster. CeeDee Lamb produced just **11.0 points**. The curse's residue from Week 9 clearly still clings to Eli's franchise, weakening his stars in their moment of need. When your opponent scores more than double your total, you don't question whether bad luck was involved. You KNOW dark forces are at play.

Chris improves to 9-2. Eli falls to 5-6, desperately clinging to playoff hopes while the curse's shadow looms.

---

#### **The Curse Bearer Falls: Pete's Team (98.0) vs. Aaron's Team (60.0)**

Here it is. The main event. The moment the curse officially transferred hosts.

Aaron's Team limped to **60.0 points**--the lowest score in the entire league this week. This is Aaron's THIRD time carrying the Turkey Curse this season, a dubious distinction that demands explanation. Is Aaron simply unlucky? Is he making poor lineup decisions? Or has he, perhaps, once consumed turkey in an inappropriate manner that offended the poultry overlords?

The numbers tell a grim story. Tetairoa McMillan carried an almost unbelievable load with **25.0 points**, representing nearly half of Aaron's entire team output. After that? Darkness. Mark Andrews and Bam Knight each contributed **8.0 points**. Javonte Williams added **6.0 points**. Chase McLaughlin kicked for **5.0 points**. The rest? Crumbs and dust.

Pete's Team, meanwhile, rode Sean Tucker's incredible **33.0-point** performance to an easy victory. Nico Collins, Jared Goff, and Travis Kelce each added **14.0 points**. Pete didn't need to be spectacular--he just needed to show up against a curse-afflicted opponent.

Pete improves to 6-5, safely in the playoff hunt. Aaron falls to 2-9, mathematically alive but spiritually deceased.

---

#### **The Underdog Strikes: Cal's Team (109.5) vs. Dan's Team (98.0)**

Cal's Team delivered a workmanlike victory that the curse watchers would call "suspiciously efficient." Bijan Robinson led the charge with **25.0 points**, followed by a mysterious **16.0-point** contribution from an unnamed defensive force. Trevor Lawrence added **13.0 points** in what may be the most Trevor Lawrence-esque performance of the season--not flashy, but enough.

Dan's Team put up a respectable fight. Kyren Williams churned out **14.0 points**. Kenneth Walker III, Deebo Samuel, Geno Smith, and Marcus Mariota all contributed **11.0 points** each in an eerily balanced effort. But curiously, Saquon Barkley--one of the best running backs in football--managed only **6.0 points**. Was this the curse's residual influence, weakening fantasy studs from afar? The evidence mounts.

Nick Folk's pathetic **1.0 point** may have been the difference. When your kicker scores 1.0 and you lose by 11.5, the math is haunting.

Cal improves to 6-5. Dan drops to 4-7 and must now pray for playoff miracles.

---

#### **The Expected Beating: Joe's Team (91.0) vs. Mike's Team (65.5)**

Joe's Team secured a comfortable victory behind the unlikely hero Jacoby Brissett, who threw for **25.0 points** in what can only be described as "the most points Jacoby Brissett has ever been responsible for in anyone's fantasy season." George Pickens added **17.0 points**, and Justin Fields contributed **16.0 points** despite not being a starter anymore. James Cook III added **11.0 points**.

Mike's Team couldn't get anything going. Baker Mayfield led with **13.0 points**, and Jordan Love added **12.0 points**, but after that, the well ran dry. The curse may have visited Mike back in Week 6 (when he scored that infamous 50.0 points), and perhaps some of its malevolence still lingers in his lineup decisions.

Joe improves to 9-2, tied with Chris atop the standings. Mike falls to 4-7, likely watching playoffs from the outside.

---

#### **The Mitch Machine Grinds On: Mitch's Team (93.0) vs. Sean's Team (76.0)**

Mitch needed this win, and he got it through the power of the San Francisco connection. Brock Purdy passed for **21.0 points** while George Kittle caught for **19.0 points**. Xavier Legette added **14.0 points**, and Kareem Hunt contributed **11.0 points**. It wasn't pretty, but the curse-watcher notes that Mitch has ALSO been claimed by the Turkey Curse twice this season (Weeks 5 and 7). Perhaps he has developed some immunity through repeated exposure?

Sean's Team couldn't overcome the disappearance of Justin Jefferson, who managed only **3.0 points**. Breece Hall, supposedly a league-winning pick, also produced just **3.0 points**. When your two best players combine for 6.0 points, you're already dead before the turkey's even in the oven.

Travis Etienne Jr. (**19.0 points**) and Devin Singletary (**16.0 points**) tried to save the day, but it wasn't enough.

Mitch improves to 5-6. Sean drops to 3-8, officially eliminated from all hope and happiness.

---

#### **The Comeback Kids: Matt's Team (94.0) vs. Bruce's Team (67.5)**

Matt's Team entered this week fresh off a curse-carrying Week 10 performance of 49.5 points. The ancient texts suggested he would still be weakened. Instead, Matt proved that shaking off the Turkey Curse is possible--if you have Bryce Young, Christian McCaffrey, and Derrick Henry.

Bryce Young went absolutely nuclear with **32.0 points**. Christian McCaffrey added **30.0 points** in his return to relevance. Derrick Henry contributed **17.0 points**. These three players alone outscored Bruce's entire roster.

Bruce's Team simply couldn't compete. Drake Maye led with just **14.0 points**, and no other player cracked double digits. The team's **67.5 points** puts them dangerously close to curse territory, but they were saved by Aaron's even more pathetic performance.

Matt improves to 7-4 and looks playoff-bound. Bruce falls to 6-5 and must remain vigilant.

---

### THE BUST BRIGADE: When Stars Align Against You

The curse works in mysterious ways. Sometimes it claims an entire team. Other times, it merely reaches out to taint individual performances:

- **Justin Jefferson (Sean's Team): 3.0 points** - The curse whispered in his ear
- **Breece Hall (Sean's Team): 3.0 points** - Double-cursed on the same roster
- **Saquon Barkley (Dan's Team): 6.0 points** - The MVP candidate looked mortal
- **Lamar Jackson (Mitch's Team): 6.0 points** - Even Ravens can't escape the gobble
- **Brock Bowers (Bruce's Team): 3.0 points** - The rookie sensation was silenced

These players were supposed to dominate. Instead, they withered under the Turkey Curse's far-reaching shadow.

### THE WEEK 12 PROPHECY: Where The Curse Spreads Next

The ancient rules are clear: **whoever plays the cursed team risks contamination.**

Week 12 Matchup: **Joe's Team vs. Aaron's Team**

Joe, currently 9-2 and seemingly unstoppable, must now face the Three-Time Curse Carrier. The prophecy states that if Joe loses to Aaron, the curse will claim HIM as its new vessel--a catastrophic fall from grace for the co-league leader.

But there's hope. Joe's Team has scored 1,341.5 cumulative points. His roster is strong. The curse's power may shatter against his defenses like waves against a cliff.

Or... the curse may find a way. It always finds a way.

**Other Week 12 Matchups:**
- Chris's Team vs. Mitch's Team (Battle of Former Curse-Bearers)
- Dan's Team vs. Pete's Team (Two Middling Squads Clash)
- Cal's Team vs. Bruce's Team (Playoff Positioning)
- Mike's Team vs. Sean's Team (The Cellar Dweller Classic)
- Eli's Team vs. Matt's Team (Curse Recovery Programs Collide)

### REMEDIES FOR THE CURSED: Ancient Wisdom

For Aaron, should he wish to break free from the Turkey Curse's grip, the ancient texts suggest:

1. **The Sacrifice of the Bench Player** - Drop your worst player at exactly midnight
2. **The Forbidden Trade** - Offer a cursed player to an unsuspecting league member
3. **The Ritual of the Waiver Wire** - Claim exactly three players on Tuesday, in alphabetical order
4. **The Traditional Plea** - Simply score more than 60 points next week

The curse has claimed Aaron three times. Only he can decide if there will be a fourth.

### FINAL WARNINGS

As we approach Thanksgiving Week, the Turkey Curse grows ever more powerful. The gobbling intensifies. The shadows lengthen. And somewhere, in a league not so different from our own, another owner is about to discover what happens when you anger the poultry gods.

Set your lineups wisely.

*The Turkey Curse sees all. The Turkey Curse knows all. The Turkey Curse scores 60.*

---

**NEXT WEEK:** Will Joe break the curse's grip on Aaron? Will Chris's dominance continue? Will Mitch shake off his history as a two-time curse-bearer? All this and more in Week 12 of THE TURKEY CURSE CHRONICLES.

*Gobble gobble, fantasy managers. Gobble gobble.*
