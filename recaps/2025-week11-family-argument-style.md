# Week 11 Fantasy Football Recap: The Thanksgiving Dinner Blowout

## "Pass the Gravy and the Excuses, Please"

*The scene: A dining room table groaning under the weight of turkey, mashed potatoes, and twelve fantasy football managers who absolutely cannot keep it civil for one holiday meal.*

---

### SETTING THE TABLE (and the Drama)

The smell of turkey wafted through the air as the family gathered around the Thanksgiving table, but the real feast was about to be served in the form of piping hot takes and ice-cold receipts. Grandma had barely finished saying grace when Uncle Chris - yes, THAT Chris - stood up, cleared his throat, and announced to the entire table that he had just dropped a 155-point bomb on his cousin Eli's head.

"One hundred and fifty-five points," Chris repeated, louder this time, making sure the neighbors could hear. "Josh Allen alone put up 48 points. FORTY-EIGHT. My quarterback scored more than your entire team, Eli. Well, almost." The table erupted. Forks clattered. A dinner roll was thrown. This was going to be a long night.

Grandma tried to intervene, suggesting everyone take a breath and remember what they were thankful for. "I'm thankful for Josh Allen's cannon arm and TreVeyon Henderson's 27-point explosion," Chris shot back, sitting down with a smug grin that could curdle gravy. Eli just stared at his plate of disappointment, watching his season hopes dissolve faster than the butter on his sweet potatoes.

## THE HEADLINER: Uncle Chris's Victory Lap That Never Ended

### Chris's Team 155.0 vs. Eli's Team 79.0 - "The Massacre at the Kids' Table"

Let us speak of dominance. Let us speak of the kind of beatdown that makes families consider whether blood is really thicker than water. Chris rolled into Week 11 and proceeded to commit acts of fantasy violence upon his younger cousin that should probably be reported to someone.

Josh Allen was the main course, carving up defenses like a master chef working on a heritage turkey. The Bills QB delivered a transcendent 48-point performance that had Chris doing laps around the dining room table, napkin tucked into his collar, arms raised in triumph. But wait, there is more! Dak Prescott - yes, Chris is rostering TWO elite quarterbacks because why not - added another 29 points. That is 77 points from the quarterback position alone. Let that sink in like a biscuit in gravy.

TreVeyon Henderson continued the carnage with 27 points, while Jameson Williams chipped in 14. Even Chris's depth pieces produced: De'Von Achane (9), Jordan Addison (8), Jake Ferguson (8), and Tyler Allgeier (8) all contributed to this symphony of suffering. Sure, Chris had some zeros from Josh Jacobs, Tony Pollard, RJ Harvey, and Rome Odunze - players on bye or injured - but when your starters outscore your opponent's entire roster by 76 points, who cares?

Eli, meanwhile, sat at the kids' table with his 79-point effort, wondering where it all went wrong. Kenneth Gainwell tried to keep things respectable with 22 points, and Trey McBride added 17. Patrick Mahomes showed up with a pedestrian 14 points - a far cry from his usual dominance. CeeDee Lamb managed just 11 points, and then came the parade of zeros: Amon-Ra St. Brown (0), David Montgomery (0), Tua Tagovailoa (0), T.J. Hockenson (0), and five other goose eggs. "The Lions had a bye week," Eli muttered defensively. "And Joe Mixon is hurt. And Tua. And basically everyone else."

"Sounds like excuses to me," Chris replied, reaching for another drumstick. Grandma sighed heavily.

## THE SIBLING SHOWDOWN: Mitch vs. Sean

### Mitch's Team 93.0 vs. Sean's Team 76.0 - "The Battle of Mediocrity"

At the other end of the table, brothers Mitch and Sean engaged in a matchup that could best be described as two mediocre teams throwing lukewarm punches at each other while the rest of the family watched with mild interest.

Mitch emerged victorious with 93 points, led by Brock Purdy's solid 21-point outing and George Kittle's reliable 19 points. Xavier Legette (14) and Kareem Hunt (11) provided secondary scoring, while Stefon Diggs contributed 9 points off the bench. "This is what smart roster management looks like," Mitch proclaimed, adjusting his imaginary monocle. His brother was not impressed.

Sean's 76 points came primarily from Travis Etienne Jr.'s 19-point effort and Devin Singletary's 16 points. Cam Ward and Joe Flacco each put up 11 points in what appeared to be a quarterback-by-committee situation born of desperation rather than strategy. But Sean's star power completely abandoned him: Justin Jefferson managed just 3 points, Breece Hall contributed a paltry 3, and Jaylen Waddle matched with another 3-spot.

"Justin Jefferson had 3 points," Mitch announced to the table, as if reporting a weather phenomenon. "The best receiver in football. Three. Points."

"He's been dealing with a hamstring issue," Sean shot back.

"Sounds like something a loser would say," their father interjected unhelpfully, before Grandma shushed everyone and demanded someone pass the cranberry sauce.

## THE QUIET COUSIN: Cal's Methodical Victory

### Cal's Team 109.5 vs. Dan's Team 98.0 - "The One Who Doesn't Need to Brag"

While Chris monopolized the conversation with his 155-point masterpiece, Cal quietly notched the second-highest score of the week with 109.5 points. He said nothing. He ate his turkey. He smiled serenely.

Bijan Robinson anchored Cal's roster with a 25-point performance that reminded everyone why he was a first-round pick. The Steelers defense contributed 16 points - a defensive unit that actually produced! Trevor Lawrence added 13, while the supporting cast of Drake London (9), Jaxon Smith-Njigba (9), Tyrone Tracy Jr. (9), and Tre Tucker (8) provided the depth scoring that separates the contenders from the pretenders.

Dan, meanwhile, fell just short at 98 points despite fielding what looked like a respectable lineup on paper. Kyren Williams led the way with 14 points, followed by Kenneth Walker III (11), Deebo Samuel (11), and Geno Smith (11). Marcus Mariota came off the bench for 11 more. But the real story was the underperformance of Dan's supposed stars. Saquon Barkley - SAQUON BARKLEY - put up just 6 points. Six. Aaron Rodgers contributed 5, continuing his descent into fantasy irrelevance.

"How does Saquon score 6 points?" someone asked from across the table.

Dan said nothing, aggressively buttering a roll.

"He had that one huge game earlier," Cal offered diplomatically, "but regression comes for us all."

"Shut up, Cal."

## THE UNDERDOG RISES: Pete Over Aaron

### Pete's Team 98.0 vs. Aaron's Team 60.0 - "The Revenge of the Forgotten Son"

There is always that one cousin who shows up to Thanksgiving dinner, says nothing all night, and then casually mentions they just got promoted to VP. That cousin is Pete this week.

Pete put together a quietly dominant 98-point performance led by the unlikely hero Sean Tucker, who exploded for 33 points off the waiver wire. Sean Tucker! The guy half the league did not even know was rostered! This was the fantasy equivalent of bringing a mystery casserole that turns out to be the best dish at the table. Jared Goff (14), Travis Kelce (14), Nico Collins (14), and Matthew Stafford (10) provided steady veteran production.

Aaron, Pete's opponent, had the look of a man who had been personally victimized by the bye week gods. His 60-point effort was almost entirely carried by rookie sensation Tetairoa McMillan's 25-point breakout. After that? A wasteland. Mark Andrews scraped together 8 points. Bam Knight contributed 8. Javonte Williams added 6. Then the zeros piled up like uneaten Brussels sprouts: Zach Charbonnet, Tank Bigsby, and the Cardinals defense all contributed nothing. With Kyler Murray on IR nursing a foot injury, Aaron's season was looking increasingly bleak.

"I have Kyler Murray and he's out," Aaron complained.

"We all have problems," Aunt Martha replied curtly, refilling her wine glass.

## THE MORAL VICTORY: Matt Defeats Bruce

### Bruce's Team 67.5 vs. Matt's Team 94.0 - "At Least Someone Showed Up"

Matt, who rarely raises his voice at family gatherings, had reason to feel quietly satisfied with his 94-point output. Bryce Young - yes, THAT Bryce Young, the former bust everyone had written off - erupted for 32 points. Christian McCaffrey, finally healthy and back on the field, added 30 more. Derrick Henry contributed a solid 17. Matt's trio of elite players finally showed up on the same week.

Bruce, on the other hand, posted a season-low 67.5 points that had everyone exchanging concerned glances. Drake Maye led the way with just 14 points. Bhayshul Tuten added 11. Van Jefferson and Jaleel McLaughlin each contributed 8. The rest? Silence. Ja'Marr Chase - ZERO. DK Metcalf - ZERO. Calvin Ridley on IR with a fibula injury - you guessed it, ZERO.

"Where's Ja'Marr Chase?" someone asked.

"Bye week," Bruce mumbled into his mashed potatoes.

"And DK?"

"Also bye."

"Sounds like you should have checked the schedule before draft day."

"THAT'S NOT HOW THIS WORKS, KAREN."

Grandma loudly announced that dessert was ready and that anyone who continued talking about fantasy football would not receive pie.

## THE BASEMENT BATTLE: Joe vs. Mike

### Joe's Team 91.0 vs. Mike's Team 65.5 - "When Nobody Watches"

In the fantasy equivalent of a preseason game at 1 PM on a Sunday, Joe defeated Mike in a matchup that neither team's fans (imaginary as they are) will remember fondly.

Joe's 91 points came from an unlikely source: Jacoby Brissett (25 points), who apparently remembered he was an NFL quarterback for one glorious afternoon. George Pickens added 17, Justin Fields contributed 16, and James Cook chipped in 11. It was not pretty, but it was enough.

Mike's 65.5 points marked his second consecutive week of disappointment. Baker Mayfield led with 13 points, Jordan Love added 12, and Jahmyr Gibbs contributed 9. But the rest of the lineup was a symphony of mediocrity and silence. Tee Higgins managed 11 points despite being listed as Out for Thursday's game (a stat correction for his previous week performance). The zeroes came fast and furious: Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Tyjae Spears, Mason Taylor, and multiple defenses all contributed nothing.

"I'm rebuilding," Mike announced defensively.

"You've been rebuilding for three years," his sister replied.

## THE BUST BRIGADE: Who Let Us Down

The real losers this week were not the teams - they were the "stars" who posted goose eggs while their owners watched in horror:

- **Saquon Barkley (6.0 pts)** - The former league MVP produced like a backup
- **Justin Jefferson (3.0 pts)** - Three points from JJ is a crime against humanity
- **Lamar Jackson (6.0 pts)** - The actual NFL MVP continues his fantasy drought
- **Ja'Marr Chase (0.0 pts)** - Bye week, but still stings
- **Breece Hall (3.0 pts)** - What happened to this man?
- **The Entire Lions Offense (0.0 pts)** - Bye week wiped out multiple rosters

---

## CLOSE CALLS AND HEARTBREAKS

The closest matchup of the week belonged to Cal vs. Dan, separated by just 11.5 points (109.5 to 98.0). Had Saquon Barkley remembered how to play football, Dan might have stolen this one. Had Aaron Rodgers thrown for more than 150 yards, the outcome could have shifted. Instead, Cal's depth and smart streaming choices proved the difference.

Mitch vs. Sean (93.0 to 76.0) looked closer than it was - a 17-point gap that felt wider as Sean watched his star receivers post single-digit fantasy days.

## LOOKING AHEAD: Week 12 Predictions

As the pumpkin pie was served and the arguments finally died down, the family looked toward next week with renewed hope (and renewed grievances). Chris will inevitably keep bringing up his 155-point week until at least New Year's. Eli will continue to blame injuries. Aaron needs Kyler Murray back desperately. And somewhere, Grandma is just hoping everyone can be civil for Christmas.

The playoff race is heating up, and with bye weeks still affecting rosters, expect more volatility in the coming weeks. Those who planned ahead for depth will thrive. Those who didn't? Well, there's always the consolation bracket.

Until next week, remember: Fantasy football is supposed to be fun. Unless you're Eli this week. Then it's definitely not fun.

*Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. May your turkey be moist, your gravy be smooth, and your fantasy points be plentiful.*
