# Week 11 Recap: A Lesson in Competence and Cowardice
*As told by Ron Ulysses Swanson*

---

## The State of Things

*[Ron sits at his desk, a glass of Lagavulin 16 in hand, staring directly at the camera with the intensity of a man who has just witnessed both greatness and abject failure]*

Listen here. I don't normally concern myself with fantasy sports. They're games within games, which is two levels of removal from actual productivity. But when Leslie asked me to review this week's performances, I agreed on one condition: I tell it exactly as I see it. No sugar-coating. No participation trophies. Just cold, hard facts delivered with the warmth of a meat locker in January.

Week 11 of the 2025 fantasy football season has concluded, and what I witnessed can only be described as a masterclass in both excellence and incompetence. Some of you performed like men who know how to swing a hammer and build something with their bare hands. Others performed like Jerry when he tries to do literally anything. The gap between competence and failure has never been more apparent, and I respect that. Clear winners and clear losers. No gray area. That's how nature intended it.

Before we dive into the bloodbath, let me establish something: In my world, there are only two types of people - those who deliver results and those who make excuses. This week sorted everyone into their proper categories with the efficiency of a well-oiled bandsaw. The wheat has been separated from the chaff, and brother, there's a lot of chaff.

## The Alpha: Chris Dominates Like a Man Should (155.0 points)

*[Ron leans back, a rare hint of approval crossing his face]*

Chris's Team put up 155 net points against Eli's pathetic 79. This wasn't a victory; it was a public execution performed with the precision of a master craftsman. When you score nearly double your opponent's output, you're not playing fantasy football - you're teaching a masterclass in dominance.

Josh Allen threw for 48 fantasy points. Forty-eight. That's not quarterbacking; that's warfare. The man played with the fury of someone defending his property from government overreach. Every touchdown pass was thrown with the force of a man splitting oak with a single swing. Allen didn't just beat defenses; he demoralized them. He made grown men question their career choices. This is what peak performance looks like - no committees, no collaboration, just one man imposing his will on eleven others.

But Chris didn't stop there. No, he deployed Dak Prescott for another 29 points because apparently, one elite quarterback performance wasn't enough humiliation for poor Eli. Then TreVeyon Henderson bulldozed his way to 27 points, running through defenders like I run through vegans at Whole Foods - with purpose and without apology. This wasn't fantasy football; this was a tutorial on how to destroy another man's will to compete.

Meanwhile, Eli managed 79 points. Seventy-nine. I've seen more fight in a plate of eggs. Kenneth Gainwell's 22 points and Trey McBride's 17 were like bringing a butter knife to a gunfight - technically you're armed, but everyone knows how this ends. Eli, son, when your opponent outscores you by 76 points, it's time to reevaluate your life choices. Maybe take up knitting. At least then when you fail, you'll have a mediocre scarf to show for it.

## The Quiet Professional: Pete's Surgical Strike (98-60)

*[Ron nods with genuine respect]*

Pete's victory over Aaron was like watching a skilled butcher work - clean, efficient, no wasted motion. Ninety-eight points to sixty. That's a 38-point margin of victory that says "I came here to do a job, and I did it."

Sean Tucker exploded for 33 points, and I mean exploded like a perfectly timed demolition. This wasn't luck; this was preparation meeting opportunity and shaking its hand firmly while maintaining eye contact. Tucker ran like a man fleeing from his feelings - powerfully and without looking back. Thirty-three points from a running back is what we in the business call "getting it done." No excuses, no explanations needed. Just results.

Aaron, on the other hand, fielded a roster that looked like it was assembled by committee - which is to say, it was terrible. Tetairoa McMillan's 25 points was like finding a perfectly cooked ribeye at a vegan restaurant - surprising, appreciated, but ultimately not enough to save the meal. When your quarterback situation includes Jayden Daniels (Out) and Kyler Murray (Injured Reserve), you're not managing a team; you're conducting a funeral. Sixty points isn't a score; it's a cry for help.

The fact that Aaron had ELEVEN players either score zero or not play at all tells me everything I need to know. Ja'Marr Chase: zero. DK Metcalf: zero. Calvin Ridley: zero. That's not a receiving corps; that's a support group for underachievers. Aaron, when you have that many zeros on your roster, you're not playing fantasy football - you're participating in performance art, and nobody wants to see it.

## The Meat Grinder Matchups

*[Ron pours another Lagavulin, his expression darkening]*

### Joe Defeats Mike: The Battle of Mediocrity (91-65.5)

Joe's Team managed 91 net points to Mike's 65.5, which is like winning a fight between two men arguing over whether turkey bacon counts as real bacon. (It doesn't, by the way. Turkey bacon is a lie told by cowards.)

Jacoby Brissett put up 25 points for Joe, which in any other week would be respectable. But when that's your highest scorer, you're not winning so much as you're losing less badly than the other guy. George Pickens added 17 points, and Justin Fields contributed 16, which is like saying you built a shed using mostly duct tape and hope - it might stand, but nobody's impressed.

Mike's 65.5 points is what happens when you treat fantasy football like a hobby instead of a blood sport. Emari Demercado was out, and the rest of his roster performed like they were being paid by the hour instead of by results. Mike, 65.5 points isn't a score; it's what you'd expect from someone who orders their steak well-done and puts ketchup on it.

### Matt Edges Matt's Team Over Bruce (94-67.5)

*[Ron shakes his head slowly]*

First of all, calling yourself "Matt's Team" when you're Matt isn't creative; it's what happens when you lack the imagination to come up with something better. But at least Matt backed it up with 94 points, powered by Bryce Young's surprising 32 points and Christian McCaffrey's professional 30.

Bruce's 67.5 points is what rock bottom looks like when it's trying to be polite about it. Ja'Marr Chase, your first-round pick presumably, scored ZERO points. Zero. That's not a performance; that's an absence. DK Metcalf: zero. Calvin Ridley: Injured Reserve. Nick Chubb: zero. Jerry Jeudy: zero. Bruce, when five of your skill position players combine for zero points, you haven't fielded a team - you've organized a flash mob of disappointment.

The fact that Bruce's team is somehow 6-5 after this performance is proof that even a broken clock is right twice a day, and even a blind squirrel finds a nut occasionally. But this week, Bruce was neither. He was just a man watching his fantasy team perform like government employees on a Friday afternoon - technically present but accomplishing nothing.

### Mitch's Narrow Escape Over Sean (93-76)

Mitch's Team squeaked past Sean's Team 93-76 in what I can only describe as a pillow fight where somebody eventually had to be declared the winner. Brock Purdy's 21 points and George Kittle's 19 were workmanlike performances - nothing fancy, just showing up and doing the job. That's respectable, like a plainly cooked piece of meat. No frills, but it gets the job done.

Sean managed 76 points despite Travis Etienne Jr. (19 points) and Devin Singletary (16 points) actually showing up to work. But when your next highest scorer is in single digits, you're not competing; you're participating. And as I've said many times, participation trophies are for children and communists.

### Cal Holds Off Dan (109.5-98)

Finally, a matchup between two teams that actually showed up to play. Cal's 109.5 points narrowly defeated Dan's 98 in what was the only competitive matchup worth discussing. Bijan Robinson's 25 points led the way for Cal, running with the determination of a man who actually wants to win. The Steelers defense added 16 points because apparently, Cal understands that defense wins championships and fantasy matchups.

Dan's 98 points would have beaten half the league this week, which makes this loss sting like accidentally grabbing the wrong end of a hot grill. Sometimes you do everything right and still lose. That's not weakness; that's football. But it's still a loss, Dan, and losses don't get you into the playoffs.

## Performance Tier Analysis: Separating Men from Boys

*[Ron pulls out a piece of paper, examining it like a blueprint]*

After analyzing this week's massacre, I've divided the league into four distinct categories, much like how I categorize my meats: Prime Cut, Choice, Select, and Dog Food.

**Prime Cut (150+ points):** Chris's Team stands alone at 155 points. This is what excellence looks like - no equals, no competition, just dominance. Chris didn't just win; he made everyone else question why they're even playing. This is the fantasy equivalent of dry-aged ribeye - expensive, rare, and absolutely worth it.

**Choice (90-110 points):** Cal (109.5), Pete (98), Dan (98), Matt (94), Mitch (93), and Joe (91) occupied this tier. These teams showed up, did their jobs, and went home. Nothing spectacular, but nothing embarrassing either. This is your standard sirloin - reliable, consistent, gets the job done without any fuss.

**Select (70-89 points):** Sean (76) and Eli (79) landed here, which is like ordering the fish at a steakhouse - technically it's a meal, but everyone knows you've made a mistake. These teams didn't completely embarrass themselves, but they certainly didn't cover themselves in glory either.

**Dog Food (Below 70 points):** Bruce (67.5), Mike (65.5), and Aaron (60) belong in this category, and I use the term "belong" loosely. These aren't fantasy scores; they're cries for help. When you score below 70 points in modern fantasy football, you're not competing - you're providing comic relief. This is the fantasy equivalent of gas station sushi - technically edible, but why would you?

The 95-point gap between Chris and Aaron is larger than the distance between my feelings and Leslie's scrapbooking parties. It's not just a gap; it's a chasm that speaks to the fundamental difference between those who prepare and those who hope.

## The Bust Brigade: A Monument to Failure

*[Ron's expression turns to disgust]*

Let's talk about the players who failed their owners like a government-funded infrastructure project. These aren't just bad performances; these are betrayals of trust.

Aaron's roster was a masterpiece of incompetence. Eleven players either scored zero or didn't play. ELEVEN. That's not a roster; that's a memorial service for fantasy relevance. Jayden Daniels: Out. Kyler Murray: Injured Reserve. Brian Thomas Jr.: Missing in action. Marvin Harrison Jr.: Out. When your top draft picks are watching from the sidelines, you're not managing a team - you're curating a museum of poor decisions.

Bruce's situation was equally pathetic. Ja'Marr Chase, presumably drafted in the first round, delivered a massive zero. That's like buying a chainsaw that won't start - expensive, useless, and embarrassing. DK Metcalf, Calvin Ridley, Nick Chubb, Jerry Jeudy - all zeros or injured. This isn't a receiving corps; it's a cautionary tale about the importance of depth and contingency planning.

The sheer volume of zeros across the league this week was staggering. It's like watching a woodworking class where half the students are afraid to touch the tools. If you're afraid to get your hands dirty, you shouldn't be playing.

## Close Calls and Heartbreak: When Almost Doesn't Count

*[Ron straightens in his chair]*

There were two matchups this week decided by less than 20 points, which in fantasy terms is like losing a fight by split decision - you were in it, but you still lost.

Mitch's 17-point victory over Sean (93-76) was the week's second-closest margin. Sean had the pieces with Etienne and Singletary performing adequately, but adequate doesn't win championships. It's like building a chair that wobbles - technically it's furniture, but nobody wants to sit in it.

Cal's 11.5-point win over Dan (109.5-98) was the narrowest margin of the week, and the only matchup where both teams showed up ready to compete. Dan scored 98 points and lost. That's like grilling a perfect steak only to drop it on the ground - you did everything right, but the universe had other plans. This is the only loss this week that isn't shameful. Sometimes you lose to a better man on a given day. That's competition.

## The Playoff Picture: Natural Selection at Work

*[Ron unfolds a larger piece of paper, studying it intently]*

After eleven weeks, the playoff picture is becoming clear, and it looks exactly like natural selection should - the strong survive, the weak perish.

Chris (9-2) and Joe (9-2) have separated themselves from the pack like apex predators. They're not just winning; they're establishing dominance. Chris's 1,409 total points and Joe's 1,341.5 points show consistency and excellence. These aren't lucky teams; these are teams that show up every week ready to work.

Matt (7-4) sits in third place, which is like being the third-best steakhouse in town - respectable, but nobody's first choice. The middle tier of Cal, Bruce, and Pete (all 6-5) are fighting for the final playoff spots like men fighting over the last piece of bacon - desperately and without dignity.

At the bottom, we have Aaron at 2-9, which isn't a record - it's a resignation letter. When you've lost nine games out of eleven, you're not competing; you're donating points to others. It's charity work, and while charity has its place, fantasy football isn't it.

The six-point difference between the sixth and seventh seeds might as well be the Grand Canyon. Some of you are going to make the playoffs, and some of you are going to watch from home, which is where you belong if you can't score more than 70 points in a week.

## Looking Ahead: The Reckoning Approaches

*[Ron finishes his Lagavulin and sets the glass down firmly]*

We're entering Week 12, and for some of you, the season is already over. You know who you are. You're the ones whose players are either injured, incompetent, or both. You're playing out the string like a bad marriage - going through the motions but knowing it's over.

For those still in contention, here's my advice: Stop overthinking. Stop looking at matchups and advanced metrics. Play your best players, the ones who show up and do their jobs. Fantasy football, like life, rewards those who consistently perform, not those who occasionally excel.

Chris has established himself as the man to beat, which means everyone else is playing for second place unless they can figure out how to stop a team that drops 155 points like it's nothing. That's like trying to stop a charging bull with harsh language - theoretically possible, but practically stupid.

## The Injury Report: The Walking Wounded

*[Ron pulls out a medical chart, examining it with disdain]*

The injured list reads like a roster of the damned:

**Out for Week 11:**
- Jayden Daniels (Aaron's Team) - Quarterback
- C.J. Stroud (Matt's Team) - Quarterback  
- Joe Mixon (Eli's Team) - Running back
- Brandon Aiyuk (Pete's Team) - Wide receiver
- Terry McLaurin (Mitch's Team) - Wide receiver
- Marvin Harrison Jr. (Aaron's Team) - Wide receiver
- Emari Demercado (Mike's Team) - Running back

**On Injured Reserve (Season Likely Over):**
- Kyler Murray (Aaron's Team) - Quarterback, mid-foot sprain
- Calvin Ridley (Bruce's Team) - Wide receiver, fibula
- Sam LaPorta (Pete's Team) - Tight end, back
- Michael Penix Jr. (Mitch's Team) - Quarterback, torn ACL
- Cam Skattebo (Mitch's Team) - Running back, ankle

Injuries are part of football, like splinters are part of woodworking. But when you have this many injuries, you're either unlucky or unprepared. Either way, it's your problem to solve, not mine to sympathize with.

## Final Verdict

*[Ron stands, preparing to leave]*

Week 11 separated the competent from the incompetent with surgical precision. Chris dominated like a man who knows what he's doing. Aaron and Bruce failed like men who don't. Everyone else fell somewhere in between, which is where mediocrity lives.

To those who scored over 100 points: You did your job. Nothing more, nothing less.

To those who scored between 70 and 100: You participated. Congratulations on showing up.

To those who scored below 70: You failed. Not just at fantasy football, but at the basic concept of competition. You're the participation trophy generation personified, and I have no respect for that.

Next week, some of you will improve. Some of you will continue to fail. But all of you will be measured by one simple metric: results. Because in the end, that's all that matters. Not your feelings, not your excuses, not your elaborate theories about why you lost. Just results.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a scotch to finish and some woodworking to do. Both activities are more productive than watching Bruce's team attempt to play fantasy football.

Remember: There's no crying in fantasy football. There's only winning and learning why you lost.

*[Ron exits, leaving only an empty glass and the harsh truth of Week 11 behind]*
