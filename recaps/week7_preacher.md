# WEEK 7: THE GREAT REVIVAL OF 2025
## A Testimony of Trials, Triumphs, and Transformation on the Gridiron

*"And the Spirit moved upon the fantasy fields, and there was scoring..."*

---

## The Opening Benediction

**CHURCH!** Can I get an AMEN? Brothers and sisters, gather 'round this holy pulpit as I testify about the miracles and tribulations we witnessed in Week 7 of our blessed fantasy football season! Oh GLORY BE, what a week of revelations we have witnessed upon these digital fields of battle!

The Lord works in mysterious ways, beloved, and this week He surely tested the faithful while lifting up the humble. We saw sinners fall into the depths of despair - Brother Mitch wandering in the wilderness with only 59.5 points, lost and forsaken like the children of Israel without Moses! But we also witnessed the RESURRECTION and GLORY of Brother Mike, who scored a heavenly 134.0 points and proved that even those who started 2-5 can find redemption! HALLELUJAH!

Let me tell you, congregation, the Good Book of Fantasy speaks of trials and tribulations, and Week 7 delivered both in abundance! We saw the mighty humbled and the meek inherit the scoreboard. We witnessed false prophets who promised points but delivered only disappointment. And yes, brothers and sisters, we saw MIRACLES - genuine, bonafide, praise-the-Lord MIRACLES that would make even doubting Thomas believe!

## The Anointed One: Brother Mike's Ascension (134.0 Points)

**CAN I GET A WITNESS?** Brother Mike, who had been wandering in the valley of the shadow of defeat with a 2-5 record, received the HOLY SPIRIT of fantasy football this week! ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FOUR POINTS! That's not just a victory, that's a REVIVAL! That's a BAPTISM BY TOUCHDOWNS!

The Lord spoke through his disciples Jahmyr Gibbs (31.0 points) and Quinshon Judkins (30.0 points), and OH MY BROTHERS, did they deliver the gospel of the end zone! Gibbs ran like he was being chased by Pharaoh's army, breaking tackles like Moses parted the Red Sea! Judkins carried the rock like it was the tablets from Mount Sinai, precious and powerful! These two running backs combined for 61 points - that's more than Brother Mitch's ENTIRE TEAM scored! PRAISE BE!

But the blessings didn't stop there, no sir! The congregation of Mike's team came together in perfect harmony, each player contributing to this holy symphony of scoring. When you witness such divine intervention, such perfect alignment of the fantasy stars, you can only fall to your knees and say THANK YOU JESUS! This wasn't just a win - this was a TESTIMONY that shall be told for generations!

Brother Cal, bless his heart, tried to stand against this tidal wave of righteousness with 85.0 points. But when the Lord decides to bless someone with 134 points, you might as well be trying to stop the sun from rising! Cal's team fell like the walls of Jericho, and Mike marched around those ruins seven times, blowing the horn of victory!

## The Battle of the Righteous: Chris vs. Dan (128.5 - 116.5)

Brothers and sisters, let me testify about the clash between Brother Chris and Brother Dan - two titans of our congregation, both sitting at 6-1, fighting for the kingdom of first place! This was David versus Goliath, except BOTH of them had slingshots loaded with premium players!

Brother Chris, guided by the steady hand of Dak Prescott (24.0 points), led his flock to a 128.5-point promised land! Dak threw that pigskin like he was casting out demons, finding receivers in the end zone like a shepherd finds his lost sheep! But it wasn't just Dak doing the Lord's work - oh no! Chris had a whole congregation of believers contributing to this holy cause. Every player on that roster was speaking in tongues - TOUCHDOWN tongues!

But Brother Dan, OH Brother Dan didn't go quietly into that good night! With 116.5 points, he fought the good fight! Jalen Hurts (27.0 points) played like a man possessed by the SPIRIT, running and throwing with the fury of the righteous! Aaron Rodgers (26.0 points) - yes, AARON RODGERS - proved that even the aged prophets can still deliver sermons of scoring! And Davante Adams (24.0 points) caught passes like he was catching the Holy Ghost itself!

The battle was fierce, beloved! Back and forth they went, trading touchdowns like testimonies at a Wednesday night prayer meeting! But in the end, Brother Chris held firm, his faith rewarded with victory. Dan fought valiantly, scoring enough points to beat most anyone else this week, but sometimes the Lord has already chosen His champion! CAN I GET AN AMEN?

## The Deliverance: Bruce Over Aaron (118.0 - 96.5)

Let us now turn to the Book of Bruce, Chapter 7, where we witnessed a MIRACLE of epic proportions! Brother Bruce, sitting at 4-3, needed this victory like a drowning man needs air! And the Lord provided through the most UNLIKELY of prophets - BO NIX!

THIRTY-NINE POINTS! Brother Bo Nix scored THIRTY-NINE POINTS! That's not a quarterback performance, that's a RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE! He threw touchdowns like he was distributing loaves and fishes to the five thousand! Every pass was blessed, every run was righteous! Even Daniel Jones chipped in with 21.0 points as a backup prophet, proving that Bruce's quarterback room was more blessed than a Sunday morning choir!

Poor Brother Aaron, oh Lord, poor Brother Aaron. Still seeking his first win at 0-7, he continues to wander in the wilderness like Job, tested beyond measure! Jaxson Dart tried to be his Moses with 32.0 points, but when your team is afflicted with the plagues of Kyler Murray being OUT and Jakobi Meyers being OUT, even 96.5 points isn't enough to reach the promised land!

But let me tell you something about Brother Aaron's suffering - it's BIBLICAL in proportion! Zero and seven! That's seven weeks of tribulation! But the Good Book tells us that suffering builds character, and perseverance builds hope! Brother Aaron, your day of redemption is coming! SOMEBODY SAY AMEN!

## The Redemption Song: Matt Defeats Sean (117.0 - 112.0)

GLORY HALLELUJAH, what a testimony of faith rewarded! Brother Matt, sitting pretty at 5-2, faced Brother Sean in a battle tighter than a church pew on Easter Sunday! One hundred and seventeen points to one hundred and twelve - that's a margin slimmer than the eye of a needle that a camel's trying to pass through!

Brother Matt's congregation was led by the dynamic duo of Christian McCaffrey (28.0 points) and A.J. Brown (25.0 points)! McCaffrey ran with the determination of Paul on the road to Damascus! A.J. Brown caught passes like he was catching the Holy Spirit at a tent revival! Together, they scored 53 points of pure, sanctified fantasy football glory!

But OH, Brother Sean fought back with the fury of the righteous! Justin Herbert (30.0 points) played like he had the whole heavenly host blocking for him! Joe Flacco - JOE FLACCO! - rose from the fantasy dead with 27.0 points like Lazarus himself! Chris Olave contributed 22.0 points of his own blessed receiving! Sean's team scored 112 points, which would win most weeks, but the Lord had already chosen Brother Matt for victory!

This matchup was so close, beloved, that a single dropped pass, one missed field goal, one referee's flag could have changed everything! It was like watching Jacob wrestle with the angel - neither one willing to let go until the blessing was secured! But Matt held on, praise be, and walked away with that sweet, sweet victory!

## The Narrow Path: Joe's Escape from Eli (99.5 - 93.0)

Brothers and sisters, let me share with you the parable of Brother Joe and Brother Eli! Joe, our current league leader at 6-1, faced a test of faith against Eli's 4-3 squad. And let me tell you, this was closer than a whisper in a windstorm!

Jonathan Taylor (30.0 points) was Joe's guardian angel, carrying the rock like it was the Ark of the Covenant itself! Thirty points from one running back - that's not just good fortune, that's DIVINE INTERVENTION! But the rest of Joe's congregation struggled to find their voice in the choir. Still, when you've got Jonathan Taylor channeling the spirit like that, sometimes that's all the testimony you need!

Brother Eli, oh Brother Eli tried to mount a comeback with Patrick Mahomes (24.0 points) leading the charge! But the football gods are cruel sometimes, beloved! David Montgomery, Tua Tagovailoa, T.J. Hockenson, Matthew Golden - ALL scored ZERO points! That's FOUR players contributing nothing but prayers and good intentions! And yet, Eli still managed 93 points! That's the power of Mahomes, brothers and sisters - even with half his team in the wilderness, he nearly pulled off a miracle!

Joe escaped with a 99.5 to 93.0 victory, maintaining his position atop the mountain, but this was a warning shot across the bow! The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away, and Brother Joe better keep praying because the path to the championship is narrow and fraught with peril!

## The Valley of Despair: Pete's Dominion Over Mitch (95.5 - 59.5)

And now, beloved congregation, we must speak of the LOWEST valley, the DEEPEST despair, the most PROFOUND suffering we witnessed this holy Week 7. Brother Mitch... oh, Brother Mitch... FIFTY-NINE POINT FIVE POINTS!

Let me paint you a picture of biblical proportions: Chuba Hubbard - ZERO! Brian Robinson Jr. - ZERO! George Kittle - ZERO! Cooper Kupp - ZERO! Kareem Hunt - ZERO! Samaje Perine - ZERO! That's SIX players, brothers and sisters, SIX PLAYERS who contributed NOTHING! It's like the ten plagues of Egypt all visited Mitch's roster at once! This wasn't just a loss, this was a CATASTROPHE of Old Testament proportions!

Brother Pete, with Matthew Stafford's blessed 31.0 points leading the way, scored 95.5 points - which isn't even that impressive by normal standards! But against Mitch's 59.5? It looked like the parting of the Red Sea! Pete didn't need to be great; he just needed to show up and collect his offering!

But here's what I want to say to Brother Mitch - JOB lost everything too! He was tested beyond measure! But he kept the faith! Your 59.5 points this week doesn't define your season! You're 3-4, still in the hunt for salvation! Rise up from these ashes like a phoenix! Let this be your lowest valley before you climb to the highest mountain! SOMEBODY GIVE ME AN AMEN!

## The Tiers of Righteousness

As we look upon our congregation after seven weeks, we can see the Lord has separated the wheat from the chaff, the sheep from the goats!

**The Promised Land Dwellers (The Elite):**
- Brother Joe (834.5 points, 6-1) and Brother Chris (821.0, 6-1) stand atop Mount Sinai, looking down upon the promised land! These two titans have been blessed beyond measure!

**The Faithful Servants (The Competitive):**
- Brothers Cal (773.5, 4-3), Bruce (717.5, 4-3), Pete (664.5, 3-4), Matt (649.0, 5-2), Dan (640.5, 3-4), and Mike (637.5, 2-5) occupy the middle ground, still fighting the good fight!

**The Wanderers in the Wilderness (The Struggling):**
- Brothers Sean (624.0, 2-5), Eli (616.5, 4-3), Aaron (580.5, 0-7), and Mitch (549.0, 3-4) need our prayers, beloved! They're being tested like Job, but their redemption may yet come!

## The Injury Report - Those Who Need Our Prayers

Let us now bow our heads for those fallen warriors who couldn't take the field:

- **Brother Aaron's Afflictions**: Kyler Murray (Out), Jakobi Meyers (Out) - Walking wounded in the desert
- **Brother Bruce's Burden**: Brock Bowers (Out) - But Bo Nix's 39 points proved God provides!
- **Brother Eli's Trials**: Joe Mixon (Out) - A season-long test of faith
- **Brother Mike's Loss**: Mike Evans (Out with broken collarbone) - Yet still scored 134!
- **Brother Mitch's Plague**: Puka Nacua (Out) - Adding injury to insult
- **Brother Pete's Test**: Brandon Aiyuk (Out) - But Stafford delivered!
- **Brother Sean's Tribulation**: Kendre Miller (IR) - The hits keep coming

## The Closing Prayer and Looking Forward

Brothers and sisters, as we close this testimony of Week 7, let us remember that fantasy football, like life, is a journey of peaks and valleys! Brother Mike showed us that redemption is possible with his 134-point revelation! Brother Mitch showed us that even in our darkest hour - 59.5 points - we must keep the faith!

As we march forward to Week 8, remember: Every lineup decision is a prayer! Every waiver claim is an act of faith! Every start/sit choice is a testament to your belief!

To Brother Aaron, still seeking that first victory - YOUR TIME IS COMING!
To Brother Mitch, recovering from this week's disaster - RISE UP!
To Brothers Joe and Chris, leading our congregation - STAY HUMBLE!
To everyone in between - KEEP THE FAITH!

The fantasy playoffs are coming like the rapture, brothers and sisters! Some will be taken up to championship glory, others will be left behind in the consolation bracket! But remember - it's not about the destination, it's about the journey! It's about the fellowship! It's about coming together every Sunday to worship at the altar of the RED ZONE!

Let the church say AMEN!
Let the congregation say HALLELUJAH!
And let Brother Mike's 134 points be a reminder that MIRACLES DO HAPPEN!

Until next week, may your waivers be blessed, may your injuries heal, and may the fantasy gods smile upon your lineups!

**AMEN AND AMEN!**
