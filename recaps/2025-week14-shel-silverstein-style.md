# Week 14: Where the Fantasy Sidewalk Ends
## A Collection of Bittersweet Verses from Your Fantasy League
### *In the Style of Shel Silverstein*

---

*[Picture this: A child sits at a worn wooden desk, pencil in hand, surrounded by crumpled papers with team names scratched out. Above hangs a crooked mobile of tiny football players, spinning slowly in an invisible breeze.]*

---

## The Opening Verse: Listen to the Scores

Come in, come in, wherever you are--
Whether your points went near or far,
Whether your players ran for miles,
Or sat on benches, nursing their trials.
Week Fourteen brought its usual dose
Of heartbreak for some, and some got close,
But two real battles were fought this day,
While others just watched their points drift away.

So gather 'round this flickering screen,
And I'll tell you things both kind and mean,
About owners who laughed and owners who cried,
And one poor soul whose whole roster died.

## The Headliner: Chris and His Magical 161.5

*[Imagine: A boy holding an enormous balloon shaped like the number 161, floating so high it nearly touches the clouds. Other children below point upward with wonder and envy.]*

**The Boy Who Caught Lightning**

There once was an owner named Chris,
Whose roster delivered pure bliss.
Josh Allen threw forty--
Points gorgeous and sporty--
No wonder his week went like this!

But Chris wasn't playing a foe,
He just watched his point totals grow.
Tony Pollard ran twenty-eight strong,
Sam Darnold sang quarterback song,
With twenty-one points all aglow.

Dak Prescott threw nineteen more,
Josh Jacobs pushed through for fourteen,
De'Von Achane matched that score,
And RJ Harvey joined the scene--
One hundred sixty-one point five in store!

*No head-to-head battle was his,*
*But Chris floated up with a fizz,*
*The highest score known,*
*Though he stood all alone,*
*In a cloud made of fantasy bliss.*

## The First Battle: Dan Defeats Joe

*[Picture: Two children playing chess, but the pieces are tiny football players. One child smiles; the other watches a single tear roll down onto the board.]*

### Dan: 122.5 | Joe: 96.5

**The Ballad of Dan's Victory**

Joe had a team, or so he thought,
But half his players came to naught.
Ladd McConkey? Zero indeed.
George Pickens? Nothing. Cade Otton? Freed
From any obligation to try--
Just goose eggs floating through the sky.

Christian Watson gave twenty-two,
And Jacoby Brissett tried to break through
With nineteen points on his lonely quest,
But Jonathan Taylor at eleven did his best,
And Jordan Mason matched that score,
But Joe needed so much more.

Meanwhile Dan's Blake Corum ran for twenty-five,
Aaron Rodgers kept his dreams alive
With twenty-two, oh what a day!
And Marvin Mims Jr. showed the way
With twenty more, and Saquon Barkley trotted
Seventeen points before the clock had knotted.

**The Counting Rhyme**

*Dan had runners, one, two, three,*
*Corum, Saquon, Williams, see?*
*Fourteen from Kyren sealed the deal,*
*While Joe's bench players forgot how to feel.*

Joe looked at his Watson, alone in the light,
Surrounded by zeros as dark as the night.
James Cook brought six, and Dallas Goedert too,
But Eagles defense? They forgot what to do.
Xavier Worthy whispered three tiny points,
And Jalen Hurts? Six. That's it. Disappoints.

*[The chess board tilts. Dan's pieces march forward. Joe's king falls slowly, sadly, inevitably.]*

**Dan wins: 122.5 to 96.5**
A 26-point margin, quite alive,
And Joe walks home through evening's chill,
Past the sidewalk that goes uphill,
Wondering what might have been
If his players had remembered how to win.

## The Second Battle: Bruce Defeats Mike

*[Picture: A boy standing in a rainstorm without an umbrella. Lightning strikes his fantasy team behind him. Everything is on fire and wet at the same time. He doesn't even flinch anymore.]*

### Bruce: 96.0 | Mike: 92.0

**The Tragedy of Poor, Poor Mike**

*Oh, Mike.*

*Oh, Mike, Mike, Mike.*

There once was an owner named Mike,
Who thought that his roster was right.
Jahmyr Gibbs ran for thirty--
Thirty points! Strong and sturdy!
The highest scorer of anyone's night!

And Jordan Love threw twenty-one,
Young Mike thought, "This game is won!"
Fifty-one points from just two men,
Victory seemed certain then--

**But then came the silence.**

*[The illustration shows a graveyard of football helmets. Each tombstone has a name: Tyjae Spears: 0. Romeo Doubs: 0. Oronde Gadsden II: 0. Packers DST: 0. Emanuel Wilson: 0.]*

The ghosts of Mike's roster did moan,
Chris Godwin scored three, all alone,
While Quinshon Judkins gave just the same,
And Mason Taylor played that sad game,
Baker Mayfield--five, like a stone.

**The Zeros**

Zero for Tyjae Spears, not a yard,
Zero for Doubs, like a discarded card,
Gadsden gave nothing, the Packers defense too,
Jacory Croskey-Merritt? Nothing. Through.
Emanuel Wilson joined the brigade,
Of Mike's players who forgot how the game was played.

Meanwhile Bruce assembled his crew,
Michael Wilson led with twenty-five true,
Chase Brown rumbled for sixteen more,
Bo Nix threw fourteen, Jerry Jeudy the same score,
DK Metcalf added nine to the pot,
And Brock Bowers eight--that's what Mike forgot:

**You need more than two stars to shine,**
**When half your roster's on decline.**

*[Picture: Mike sitting on a curb, holding Jahmyr Gibbs like a teddy bear. Gibbs scored thirty points, but tears still fall.]*

**The Poem of Mike's Despair**

I had the league's best running back,
Thirty points! Thirty! What did I lack?
Jordan Love threw beautiful throws,
Twenty-one points that everyone knows,
But then I looked down at my sheet,
And saw the zeros, complete defeat.

*Five* players scored nothing at all,
Five! Count them! Watch my roster fall!
Daniel Carlson kicked three,
Harrison Butker? Two-point-five for me,
Kyle Monangai stumbled for five,
Devin Neal--eleven--barely alive.

I had THIRTY from Gibbs in my hand,
The top scorer across the land!
But Bruce beat me ninety-six to ninety-two,
Because my other players didn't come through,
And now I sit here in the dark,
While Gibbs's thirty points miss their mark.

**Bruce wins: 96.0 to 92.0**
*By four points. Just four.*
*And somewhere Mike is wondering what life is for.*

## The Teams Without Battles

*[A series of small illustrations: boats floating on a calm sea, each flying a different flag, racing no one but themselves.]*

**Matt's Song (118.5 points)**

Shedeur Sanders, the rookie so bright,
Threw thirty-five points into the night.
Rashid Shaheed caught twenty-three,
J.J. McCarthy added fifteen for free.
Matt sailed his boat on quiet waters,
No battles fought, just points for quarters.

**Pete's Verse (114.0 points)**

Joe Burrow threw for twenty-nine,
Matthew Stafford's twenty-four was fine,
Jared Goff brought fourteen more,
But Pete had no opponent's door
To knock upon and claim his prize--
Just points that floated toward the skies.

**Aaron's Lament (35.0 points)**

*[Picture: A boy with an empty lunch box, watching other children eat their sandwiches.]*

Kyler Murray's on Injured Reserve,
Marvin Harrison Jr. lost his nerve--
Listed as Out, producing zilch,
While Aaron's season starts to wilt.
Javonte Williams gave eleven,
Jakobi Meyers eight--not heaven,
Brian Thomas Jr. brought just six,
And Aaron's stuck in quite a fix.

Jayden Daniels? Zero. None.
Zach Charbonnet? The damage done.
Tank Bigsby? Empty. Mark Andrews too.
Will Shipley and Bam Knight? Through and through
With nothing to show for the week,
Aaron's outlook remains quite bleak.

Thirty-five points, last in the land,
Holding an empty, broken hand.

## The Bust Brigade

*[Picture: A parade of once-proud football players, now shuffling along with their heads down, carrying signs that read "We're Sorry" and "We Forgot How to Football"]*

**The Song of the Players Who Weren't**

George Pickens scored a zero, round and fat,
Justin Jefferson did the same--imagine that!
Ja'Marr Chase, the star so bright?
Zero points on Week Fourteen night.
Davante Adams? Deebo Samuel? Both?
Zero points--they broke their oath.

CeeDee Lamb gave Eli just nine,
Amon-Ra St. Brown? Only six in line.
Derrick Henry--six points too--
The King of rushing? Hardly true.
Travis Kelce brought Pete a zero, clean,
The tightest end that's never been.

Breece Hall? Nothing. Chris Olave? Same.
Keenan Allen forgot his name.
Isaiah Pacheco, Rashee Rice--
Zero points don't treat you nice.
And Kenneth Walker III for Dan?
Zero points wasn't part of the plan.

## Close Calls and Heartbreaks

*[A boy stands on one side of a canyon. On the other side, a girl holds a trophy. The gap between them is four points wide.]*

Mike lost by four. Just four tiny points.
Enough to unhinge his fantasy joints.
If Romeo Doubs had caught ONE ball,
If Tyjae Spears had run at all,
If Oronde Gadsden found his hands,
Mike might have won. But fate's demands
Required that Bruce take home the crown
While Mike watched all his hopes drown.

Four points. The width of a baby's smile.
Four points. The length of a crocodile
Named "What If" and "Almost" and "Nearly There"--
Four points of pure despair.

## The Injury Report: The Hospital Wing

*[Picture: A long hallway with doors on either side. Behind each door, a football player rests in a hospital bed, watching their fantasy dreams float away like untied balloons.]*

**The Roll Call of the Wounded**

On Aaron's team where sorrows grow:
Kyler Murray's foot says no,
Injured Reserve, might never play--
The Broncos treatment, they say.
And Marvin Harrison Jr.? Out.
His absence makes Aaron's season pout.

In Bruce's castle, Daniel Jones
Has torn his Achilles, broken bones
Of spirit if not flesh--he's done,
His season lost, his battles won
By no one now, forever more.

Cal weeps for Drake London's knee,
Listed Out, he cannot be
The receiver that he was before.

For Eli, double sadness falls:
Joe Mixon hears the injured calls,
His foot and ankle keep him out,
While Joshua Palmer goes without--
Both knee and ankle keep him still.

Mitch mourns for Michael Penix Jr.,
Whose ACL required a fixer,
Surgery done, he's on IR.
And Cam Skattebo, near and far,
Sits on reserve with injured ankle.

Pete watches Brandon Aiyuk's knee
With hope that's fading rapidly,
And Zach Ertz's torn ACL
Means Pete's tight end position fell.

For Sean, Eddy Pineiro waits
Behind the hamstring-injured gates,
And Parker Washington stays out
With injuries that leave him in doubt.

## Looking Ahead: Where the Sidewalk Ends

*[Final illustration: A sidewalk that stops at the edge of a cliff. Beyond it, only clouds and the faint outline of fantasy football playoffs.]*

**The Final Poem**

There is a place where the season ends,
Where standings matter, and fate descends,
Where winners rise and losers fall,
And fantasy football claims us all.

Chris sits atop with one-sixty-one,
But his battle was with himself, alone.
Dan beat Joe by twenty-six,
Bruce beat Mike with cruel tricks--
Or rather, with players who actually played,
While Mike's bench watched the parade.

The playoffs loom like thunderclouds,
Some will cheer in joyful crowds,
While others pack their teams away
And wait for next year's opening day.

But for now, Week Fourteen's done,
Some had fun, and some had none.
Mike had thirty from Gibbs in his hand--
The best single score across the land--
And still lost. Still lost. Still lost.

*[The boy at the desk finally sets down his pencil. He folds his paper into an airplane and throws it out the window. It catches a breeze and soars toward the moon.]*

*"Listen to the mustn'ts, child. Listen to the don'ts.*
*Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts.*
*Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me...*
*Unless you're Mike, who had Gibbs score thirty, and still lost by three--*
*Well, four. Four points. But who's counting?"*

**--Shel Silverstein (if he ran a fantasy football league)**

*The End. Or is it? The playoffs are coming...*
