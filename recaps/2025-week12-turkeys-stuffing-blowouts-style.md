# Week 12 Recap: Turkeys, Stuffing & Blowouts

**A Thanksgiving-Week Fantasy Football Feast of Failure and Fortune**

*Season 2025, Week 12*

---

## Setting the Table: A Pre-Feast Disaster Zone

Pull up a barstool, folks, because Week 12 of our fantasy football season served up more turkeys than a Butterball processing plant the week before Thanksgiving. With an average score of just 81.25 points this week - well below our season average of 94.1 - it was clear that the fantasy gods decided to stuff our stockings early with lumps of coal wrapped in disappointment. This was a week where rosters looked less like carefully curated championship contenders and more like the clearance aisle at a grocery store on November 26th: picked over, questionable, and definitely past their prime.

But amidst the carnage, amidst the sea of goose eggs and single-digit performances, there emerged heroes. There emerged gravy trains. And most importantly, there emerged enough material to roast every owner in this league like a 20-pound bird at 325 degrees for four hours. So grab your stretchy pants, pour yourself something strong, and let's carve into this disaster of a week.

## The Main Course: Joe Slaughters Aaron in the Game of the Century (For All the Wrong Reasons)

**Joe's Team 138.0 - Aaron's Team 64.5**

*The 73.5-Point Thanksgiving Massacre*

Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, we need to talk about what Joe did to Aaron this week. This wasn't a fantasy football matchup - this was the football equivalent of showing up to Thanksgiving dinner, eating all the food, drinking all the booze, and then leaving Aaron to do the dishes while his team sits in the corner crying into their cranberry sauce.

Joe's squad went absolutely nuclear this week, posting a league-leading 138.0 points - a full 56.75 points above the week's average and a performance so dominant it made Aaron's roster look like it was assembled by someone who thought "fantasy football" meant imagining what it would be like if your players actually showed up. Jalen Hurts led the charge with a magnificent 30-point performance, apparently deciding that this was the week to remember he's an elite dual-threat quarterback. But Hurts wasn't alone at the Thanksgiving feast - Wan'Dale Robinson carved up the defense like a master chef with 20 points, while James Cook (17) and George Pickens (17) provided the perfect sides to this statistical smorgasbord. Even the deep bench produced, with Jaylen Warren (11) and Christian Kirk (11) contributing meaningful points.

And then there's Aaron. Poor, sweet, innocent Aaron. His team limped into this matchup like a three-legged turkey trying to outrun the farmer, and the results were about as predictable. A total of 64.5 points sounds respectable until you realize that Jakobi Meyers' 11 points led the team. JAKOBI MEYERS LED THE TEAM. Six different players on Aaron's roster posted goose eggs, including Tank Bigsby (who apparently thought the bye week lasted two weeks), Mark Andrews (0 points from a supposed elite tight end), and Will Shipley, who contributed absolutely nothing to this holiday disaster. Aaron's now sitting at 2-10 on the season, and honestly, at this point, the only thing he should be thankful for is that the season eventually ends.

## The Dark Meat: Cal's Turducken Explosion Over Bruce

**Cal's Team 124.5 - Bruce's Team 63.0**

*61.5 Points of Pure Destruction*

You know what's impressive about Cal's Week 12 performance? It's not just that he dropped 124.5 points in a week where everyone else seemed to be playing with Pop Warner rosters. It's that he did it despite THREE of his players posting absolute donuts. That's the fantasy equivalent of showing up to the cooking competition without half your ingredients and still winning because you turned water into wine and then into a 28-point performance from Jaxon Smith-Njigba.

JSN was the star of this feast, posting a Thanksgiving-worthy 28 points that had Bruce's defenders looking like they thought "coverage" was something you put on your turkey. Trevor Lawrence chipped in a crispy 24 points, proving that Jacksonville quarterbacks CAN produce fantasy points when the football gods feel generous. And in a masterclass of backup quarterback alchemy, Caleb Williams added 21 points from the QB2 slot because Cal apparently runs deeper at quarterback than the Packers' cheese supply.

Bruce, meanwhile, watched his team lay a 63-point egg that would make even the saddest Thanksgiving host weep into their boxed stuffing. His two quarterbacks - Daniel Jones (16) and Drake Maye (14) - were actually his best performers, which tells you everything you need to know about the state of his skill position players. Nick Chubb, Jerry Jeudy, Bhayshul Tuten, and Marquise Brown all combined for a stat line that looked like someone typed a bunch of zeros and called it a day. Cal's defense posts (Steelers DST with 8 points), while Bruce couldn't even get positive production from EITHER of his defenses. Cal moves to 7-5, staying in the playoff hunt, while Bruce slides to a perfectly mediocre 6-6, as balanced as a see-saw with matching turkeys on each end.

## The Gibbs Special: Mike Survives Against Sean

**Mike's Team 98.5 - Sean's Team 67.0**

*Carried by a Lion on Thanksgiving Week*

Speaking of Thanksgiving, how fitting is it that Jahmyr Gibbs - a Detroit Lion playing in the most Thanksgiving-relevant franchise in football - decided to absolutely feast this week? Gibbs posted a monstrous 39-point performance that single-handedly accounted for 40% of Mike's team total. FORTY PERCENT. That's not a fantasy performance; that's a one-man Thanksgiving parade.

And thank goodness for Gibbs, because Mike's roster otherwise looked like the aftermath of a food coma. Jordan Love? Goose egg. Alvin Kamara? Turkey. Tee Higgins? Out with a concussion, serving up a big fat nothing. Romeo Doubs? Zeros across the board. Mike had SEVEN players post zero points this week, which would normally be a recipe for disaster, but when your RB1 decides to go full video-game mode, you can carry a lot of dead weight. Quinshon Judkins added a respectable 16 points, and the Packers defense contributed 10, but make no mistake - this was the Jahmyr Gibbs Show, and everyone else was just background extras in his Thanksgiving Day halftime performance.

Sean, playing the role of the relative who shows up empty-handed, posted only 67 points despite some decent quarterback production. Cam Ward led his team with 22 points, and Travis Etienne Jr. added 14, but after that, the cupboard was bare. Justin Jefferson posted ZERO points - that's right, the guy many consider the best receiver in football contributed absolutely nothing. Rhamondre Stevenson added to the goose-egg parade, and Sean's team slid further into the basement at 3-9, likely already planning which mock drafts to focus on for 2026.

## The Leftovers Matchup: Matt Handles Eli Like Cold Turkey

**Matt's Team 101.5 - Eli's Team 71.0**

*A 30.5-Point Stuffing Session*

Matt finally put together a roster that looked like it belonged in a playoff race this week, posting 101.5 points behind a balanced attack that would make any offensive coordinator weep tears of turkey gravy. Derrick Henry (19 points) and Christian McCaffrey (17 points) formed a two-headed monster at running back that chewed through Eli's team like your uncle chews through the dark meat at Thanksgiving. DJ Moore (19) and A.J. Brown (17) provided the receiving firepower, and suddenly Matt's team - which has looked questionable at times this season - looked like legitimate contenders.

The big story here, though, is the depth. Matt got meaningful contributions from Michael Pittman Jr. (8), DeVonta Smith (6), and even rookie Andy Borregales (9) at kicker. That's FIVE players in double digits and another three in the respectable range. When your worst performer among those who actually played is Jake Elliott (1.5), you're cooking with gas, baby.

Eli, meanwhile, served up a disappointing 71-point platter that tasted like unseasoned mashed potatoes. Amon-Ra St. Brown did his best with 17 points, and Patrick Mahomes contributed 14, but after that, the drop-off was steeper than the line at a Black Friday doorbuster. David Montgomery posted a zero despite being healthy, T.J. Hockenson added nothing, and Joshua Palmer apparently forgot he plays in the NFL. Eli sits at 5-7, just barely clinging to mathematical playoff hopes like someone clutching the last dinner roll before Aunt Edna gets to the basket.

## The "At Least We Have Stuffing" Game: Chris Edges Dan

**Chris's Team 79.5 - Dan's Team 60.5**

*The Closest Disaster of the Week*

In a matchup that could generously be described as "two teams fighting over who gets stuck cleaning the gravy boat," Chris squeaked past Dan by just 6.5 points in what was simultaneously the closest and most unwatchable game of the week. Both teams scored well below their season averages - Chris averages 124 points, posted 79.5; Dan averages 87.5, posted 60.5 - making this less of a victory and more of a "who lost less badly" competition.

Chris's savior was the return of Dak Prescott, who posted 30 points and reminded everyone that he can still sling it when healthy. Sam Darnold provided backup gravy with 16 points, but after those two? The well ran dry faster than the pumpkin pie at dessert. Josh Allen - yes, THE Josh Allen - posted just 9 points, which feels like showing up to Thanksgiving with a store-bought pie and expecting praise. Tony Pollard, Jameson Williams, and Jordan Addison all goose-egged, and Chris's receivers looked about as useful as a vegetarian at a turkey carving station.

Dan's troubles ran even deeper. Davante Adams led the way with 19 points, and Geno Smith added 14, but the Rams running backs on his roster - Kyren Williams and Blake Corum - combined for precisely zero points. Saquon Barkley, the league's rushing leader and supposed cornerstone of Dan's team, posted just 3 points. THREE. That's not a fantasy star; that's a practice squad player. Dan falls to 5-7 and needs to seriously reconsider his life choices if he wants to make a playoff push.

## The Turkey of the Week: Mitch's Team Falls to Pieces

**Chris's Team 79.5 - Mitch's Team 53.0**

*53 Points: A New Low in Thanksgiving Shame*

We saved the biggest turkey for last, folks. Mitch's team posted a league-worst 53.0 points this week, a performance so pathetic it makes you wonder if his roster got lost on the way to the stadium and ended up at an actual Thanksgiving dinner instead. This wasn't a fantasy football team; this was a group therapy session for players who forgot how to play football.

The damage report reads like a casualty list from a particularly brutal holiday gathering: Lamar Jackson (0 points, bye week), Chuba Hubbard (0), Brian Robinson Jr. (0), Cooper Kupp (0), Stefon Diggs (0), Xavier Legette (0), Vikings D/ST (0), Bears D/ST (0). That's EIGHT zeros on a single roster. EIGHT. Mitch essentially showed up to the fantasy football potluck with a bag of ice and a confused expression.

The only players who showed signs of life were Kareem Hunt (17), Brock Purdy (11), the kickers Tyler Loop and Jake Bates (combining for 13), and a smattering of scraps from Puka Nacua (6) and George Kittle (6). This is what rock bottom looks like in fantasy football, friends. Mitch slides to 5-7, but with scoring like this, he's lucky he has any wins at all. Someone check on him - not because we're worried, but because his team certainly is.

## Performance Tiers: The Haves, Have-Nots, and Have-Absolutely-Nothings

**ELITE TIER (100+ Points):**
- Joe's Team: 138.0 (Absolute domination)
- Cal's Team: 124.5 (Carried by depth)
- Matt's Team: 101.5 (Finally arrived)

These three teams ate like kings this week. If fantasy football were Thanksgiving dinner, they got the drumsticks, the best slices of white meat, and all the gravy. Joe especially deserves props for a performance that would be impressive in a normal week, let alone a week where the average score plummeted faster than your motivation to exercise after the fourth helping of stuffing.

**COMPETITIVE TIER (80-100 Points):**
- Mike's Team: 98.5 (Gibbs or bust)
- Chris's Team: 79.5 (QB-heavy survival)

Mike rode Jahmyr Gibbs like a prize thoroughbred through a field of turkeys. Chris got just enough from his quarterbacks to survive. Neither performance inspires confidence, but both got the job done.

**TURKEY TIER (60-80 Points):**
- Eli's Team: 71.0
- Sean's Team: 67.0
- Aaron's Team: 64.5
- Bruce's Team: 63.0
- Dan's Team: 60.5

Welcome to the table nobody wants to sit at - the one near the bathroom where you can hear every flush during dinner conversation. These five teams combined to average just 65.2 points this week. That's barely half of what Joe posted. These owners need to take a long, hard look at their rosters and ask themselves: "Is this really what I'm thankful for?"

**BASEMENT TIER (Sub-60 Points):**
- Mitch's Team: 53.0
- Pete's Team: 54.0

Pete and Mitch: congratulations, you've won the award nobody wants. Your teams posted the kind of numbers usually reserved for bye weeks and global catastrophes. Pete at least had a competitive game (lost by just 6.5 points to Dan), but Mitch? Brother, 53 points with a roster full of supposed studs is criminal. Someone call the fantasy police.

## The Bust Brigade: Supposed Stars Who Served Turkey

**MVP of Disappointment: Justin Jefferson (0 points, Sean's Team)**
The consensus WR1 in most formats decided to take Week 12 off, contributing absolutely nothing to Sean's already struggling squad. This is like showing up to Thanksgiving dinner as the host and forgetting to cook the turkey.

**Dishonorable Mentions:**
- Lamar Jackson (0 points, Mitch's Team) - On bye, but still painful
- Saquon Barkley (3 points, Dan's Team) - League rushing leader? Not this week.
- Travis Kelce (0 points, Pete's Team) - The tight end everyone reaches for served nothing but air
- Alvin Kamara (0 points, Mike's Team) - From stud to dud faster than your post-dinner nap
- Bijan Robinson (5 points, Cal's Team) - First-round pick, fifth-round production

---

## The Gravy: Unexpected Heroes Who Saved Thanksgiving

Sometimes the best part of Thanksgiving is the surprise dish that nobody expected to be good. Here are the players who delivered gravy when their owners needed it most:

- **Wan'Dale Robinson (20 points, Joe's Team):** A WR3 producing like a WR1. That's the good gravy, folks.
- **Trevor Lawrence (24 points, Cal's Team):** Jacksonville's quarterback actually showing up? Must be a holiday miracle.
- **Quinshon Judkins (16 points, Mike's Team):** Made Gibbs' dominance possible by being the perfect complement.
- **Andy Borregales (9 points, Matt's Team):** A kicker you've never heard of posted solid numbers. That's what Thanksgiving is all about.

## Close Calls & Heartbreaks

The Dan vs. Pete matchup deserves a moment of silence. Dan lost to Pete 60.5 to 54.0 - a game that nobody wanted to win, apparently. When your margin of victory is 6.5 points and neither team breaks 65, you're not watching fantasy football; you're watching two drowning men argue over who gets the slightly less deflated life preserver. Dan will spend all week wondering what could have been if Saquon Barkley had remembered how to play football.

## Looking Ahead: Playoff Implications

As we enter the final stretch of the regular season, the playoff picture is crystallizing like the perfect gelatin salad nobody actually eats at Thanksgiving:

**Locks:** Joe (10-2) and Chris (10-2) have clinched respectability if not mathematical playoff berths. Both sit at the top with identical records, but Joe holds the tiebreaker with a slightly higher point total (1479.5 vs 1488.5 for Chris - actually Chris leads!).

**In the Hunt:** Matt (8-4), Cal (7-5), and Bruce/Pete (both 6-6) are all fighting for those remaining spots. Matt's big Week 12 was crucial, and Cal needs to keep producing.

**Mathematical Possibilities:** Mike, Dan, Eli, and Mitch (all 5-7) are alive but need help. Sean (3-9) and Aaron (2-10) should start planning their off-season vacation.

The final weeks promise more drama, more turkeys, and hopefully fewer 53-point performances. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone - may your fantasy teams be more blessed than Mitch's.

*Generated for the league's Thanksgiving feast of failure and fortune. May your turkeys be few and your gravy be plentiful.*
