# Week 16: The Playoff Semi-Finals
## A Fantasy Football Tale in the Style of Shel Silverstein

---

### The Sidewalk Ends at the Playoffs

*Come gather 'round, you fantasy folk,*
*And hear the tale I'm about to invoke,*
*Of touchdowns and heartbreak, of glory and woe,*
*Of four brave managers putting on quite a show.*

*It's Week Sixteen, the semis are here,*
*Where champions rise and the losers shed tears,*
*But wait—don't be sad if you're trailing behind,*
*Week Seventeen's coming, there's still points to find!*

---

### THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME: Matt vs. Chris
#### "Where the Running Backs Run Wild"

There once was a fellow named Matt,
Who said, "I'll score MORE points than that!"
With Henry and CMC,
His roster ran free,
And Chris was left wondering where his points sat.

*Oh, Matt came to play with a vengeance so sweet,*
*One hundred fifty-two points—quite a feat!*
*While Chris scratched his head at one-sixteen flat,*
*And mumbled, "Now HOW in the world did he do THAT?"*

You see, Matt had runners like nobody's seen,
Derrick Henry barreled through for twenty-five clean,
And Christian McCaffrey, not one to be topped,
Scored twenty-five more—the defenses just stopped,
Stood frozen like statues, their mouths hanging wide,
As Matt's running backs took them all for a ride.

Then Rashid Shaheed caught a pass way downtown,
For twenty whole points—he was wearing the crown!
Bryce Young threw bullets for sixteen points more,
While DJ Moore caught his way to fourteen's shore.

*"But wait!" shouted Chris, "I've got Darnold and Pierce!"*
*Sam threw for twenty-three, looking quite fierce,*
*Alec Pierce hauled in twenty-two of his own,*
*And Dak Prescott added sixteen to the throne.*

De'Von Achane and RJ Harvey both tried,
Fourteen points each—they gave it their best ride,
But Tony Pollard stumbled at only nine,
And somewhere Josh Allen scored... zero point nine.

*Wait, ZERO for Allen?* I hear that you say,
*The Bills' mighty quarterback had nothing that day?*
And Josh Jacobs too, and TreVeyon as well,
All goose eggs together—a sad tale to tell.
Jordan Addison, Ferguson, Loveland, and Waller,
All scored big fat zeros—they couldn't be smaller!

So Matt rides ahead with two-seventy-eight,
While Chris trails behind at two-seventy-five—wait!
That's only THREE POINTS between first and second place,
One week still remaining to finish this race!

*The moral, dear Chris, is don't hang up your cleats,*
*Week Seventeen could bring incredible feats,*
*For three points is nothing when touchdowns are flying,*
*Keep believing, keep scheming, and never stop trying!*

### THE CONSOLATION GAME: Bruce vs. Dan
#### "The Giving Tree of Fantasy Points"

If Bruce were a tree, he'd be giving out points,
One hundred and thirty-five from all of his joints,
While Dan stood below him at ninety-one-five,
Just thankful, I guess, that his team was alive.

*Chase Brown was the star—twenty-seven points scored!*
*He ran like the wind, like a runningback lord!*
*Drake Maye threw passes for twenty-four more,*
*And Philip Rivers—yes RIVERS—had nineteen in store!*

Wait, Philip Rivers? From seasons gone by?
I rubbed both my eyes and I let out a sigh,
But there in the stats, clear as day, he appeared,
Perhaps it's a ghost, or the data got weird!
Bo Nix contributed seventeen too,
And Michael Wilson caught eleven right through.

Ja'Marr Chase had nine (not his greatest of days),
And Brock Bowers added eight in his ways—
But then he got hurt, on the IR he went,
A knee injury now, and his season's near spent.

*Now Dan had some runners, Saquon and K-Walker,*
*Nineteen and twenty—they're no fantasy stalker!*
*Zay Flowers bloomed bright with fourteen points straight,*
*And Aaron Rodgers matched that—not too late!*

But Deebo went silent, and Shakir did too,
Marvin Mims Jr. scored zero—what's new?
Kyren Williams limped in with a pitiful three,
And the Ravens D? Zero! How sad can that be?

*So Bruce takes third place with two-thirty-three total,*
*While Dan sits at fourth—though his effort was noble,*
*At two-twenty-one, there's still one week to fight,*
*Twelve points is the gap—could Dan set things right?*

### THE ONES WHO GOT ZEROES
#### "A Light in the Attic... But Nobody's Home"

*Said Josh Allen, sitting alone on the shelf,*
*"I scored zero points—I'm ashamed of myself."*
*Josh Jacobs nodded, "I feel your deep pain,*
*I too scored a goose egg, again and again."*

There's a room in my league where the zero-scorers meet,
They sit on cold benches and stare at their feet:
- Josh Allen and Jacobs (both Joshes, how strange)
- TreVeyon Henderson was way out of range
- Jordan Addison, silent as stone
- Deebo Samuel, sad and alone
- Khalil Shakir, Marvin Mims too
- DK Metcalf didn't break through
- Nick Chubb, Jerry Jeudy (the Browns were a mess)
- Marquise Brown scored nothing, I sadly confess

*The defenses joined in—Rams, Bucs, Ravens, Browns,*
*Lions, Dolphins, Colts—wearing sad little frowns,*
*"We're supposed to STOP touchdowns, not scoring attacks!"*
*They muttered and grumbled and turned their sad backs.*

### THE STANDINGS AT INTERMISSION
#### "Listen to the Mustn'ts... But Also the Scores"

Listen to the standings, child,
Listen to the "I'm-ahead"s,
Listen to the "almost-there"s,
Listen to what the scoreboard said:

| Place | Manager | Two-Week Total | Week 16 Score |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------------|
| 1st   | Matt    | 278.5 points   | 152.5         |
| 2nd   | Chris   | 275.0 points   | 116.0         |
| 3rd   | Bruce   | 233.0 points   | 135.0         |
| 4th   | Dan     | 221.0 points   | 91.5          |

*Week Fifteen saw Chris leading the pack,*
*One-fifty-nine points—he was on the attack!*
*Dan had one-twenty-nine, Matt one-twenty-six,*
*And Bruce? Ninety-eight—he was in quite a fix.*

*But oh how the tables can turn in a week!*
*Matt's Week Sixteen showing was strong, not weak,*
*While Chris's squad stumbled and fell to the floor,*
*Now Matt leads by three—but there's one week more!*

---

### THE INJURY WARD
#### "Sick"

*"I cannot play fantasy football today,"*
*Said J.J. McCarthy, tucked safely away,*
*"I've got a small fracture, right here in my hand,*
*The Vikings have ruled me quite Out, understand?"*

*Then Marcus Mariota spoke up from his bed,*
*"My hand AND my quad!" the Commander said,*
*"Dan Quinn says I'm Out for the Cowboys this week,*
*My body is broken, my outlook is bleak."*

*And Brock Bowers, the Raider, he sits on the shelf,*
*IR for his knee—he can't help himself,*
*"I gave Bruce eight points before going away,*
*Perhaps I'll come back for some bright future day."*

---

### ONE MORE WEEK TO GO
#### "The Whatifs"

*Last night while I lay thinking in my fantasy bed,*
*The Whatifs came inside and danced around my head:*
*What if Matt's running backs both trip and fall?*
*What if Chris's receivers catch every ball?*
*What if Bruce's quarterbacks all throw for five hundred yards?*
*What if Dan's Saquon Barkley plays all four guard-cards?*

*The gap's only THREE between first and second,*
*In fantasy football, strange things have been reckoned!*
*And TWELVE points from third to the fourth-place seat—*
*One big week from Dan could make history complete!*

*So don't close the book on this tale just yet,*
*Week Seventeen's coming—place your final bet,*
*Will Matt hold his lead with McCaffrey and King Henry?*
*Or will Chris storm back with plenty of plenty?*

---

### THE WEEK SIXTEEN POEM
#### "CHAMPIONS"

Champions aren't made in a single week's war,
They're built over seasons, through less and through more,
Through waiver wire pickups and trades made in haste,
Through injuries suffered and no time to waste.

Matt leads with two-seventy-eight point five,
His running back duo keeps dreams alive,
Derrick and Christian, a bruising tandem,
Twenty-five each—that's not random!

Chris trails by three with two-seventy-five,
His playoff hopes very much still alive,
Sam Darnold and Pierce were his shining lights,
But Josh Allen's zero gave managers frights.

Bruce rallied hard from Week Fifteen's low,
From ninety-eight up to one-thirty-five—whoa!
Chase Brown led the charge with twenty-seven,
That kind of performance feels close to heaven.

Dan brought up the rear at ninety-one-five,
But Walker and Barkley kept hope alive,
Twenty and nineteen from his running back corps,
One more week remains—there's still time to score!

*So here ends the tale of Week Sixteen's fight,*
*Of touchdowns at noon and fantasy night,*
*Of zeroes and heroes and points in between,*
*The wildest playoff semi-finals you've seen!*

*Come back for Week Seventeen, don't go away,*
*When champions are crowned on the final day,*
*Where three points might crumble or grow into more,*
*Where fantasy glory walks through the door!*

---

**THE END... FOR NOW**

*"Would you like to hear another?"*
*Asked Matt with a grin,*
*"There's ONE more week left*
*Before someone can win!"*
