# BREAKING: Local Fantasy Football League Enters Ninth Week Despite Clear Evidence It Should Have Been Abandoned Years Ago

## Area Men Continue Pretending Computerized Football Numbers Matter; Families Concerned

*THE FANTASY ZONE* — In what experts are calling "a devastating indictment of American masculinity," twelve grown adults continued their fantasy football league into Week 9 of the 2025 season, stubbornly refusing to acknowledge that their weekly roster decisions have the same societal impact as rearranging deck chairs on a sinking yacht made entirely of broken dreams.

### Chris's Team Scores 128.5 Points; Still Unable to Fill Void Left by Meaningful Human Connection

In a performance that witnesses described as "technically impressive but spiritually bankrupt," Chris's Team obliterated Mike's Team 128.5 to 64.5 in what league historians are already calling "The Massacre That Nobody Outside This League Will Ever Care About, Volume 347."

"I watched Josh Allen put up 30 points while Sam Darnold added 32, and for a brief moment, I forgot about my crushing mortgage debt," said Chris, whose team's dominance has yet to translate into any tangible real-world benefits. "Then I remembered that these are just numbers on a screen representing men I've never met throwing a ball to other men I've never met, and the existential dread returned."

Mike, whose 64.5-point showing ranks somewhere between "catastrophic systems failure" and "did you even set a lineup," was reportedly seen staring at his phone for three hours after the loss, occasionally muttering "Jahmyr Gibbs scored zero points" while his family ate dinner without him. Sources close to Mike confirm that Alvin Kamara's goose egg has become "the Chernobyl of his emotional landscape."

When asked for comment, Mike's wife said she hadn't noticed any difference in his demeanor, adding, "He's been dead inside since Week 3."

### Mathematical Anomaly: Bruce's Team Defeats Sean's Team by 0.5 Points in Game Nobody Will Remember Tomorrow

In what fantasy football scholars are calling "the closest margin that still doesn't matter," Bruce's Team edged Sean's Team 112.5 to 112.0 in a nail-biter that kept exactly zero neutral observers on the edge of their seats.

Bruce, who celebrated his half-point victory by doing a small fist pump alone in his home office at 11:47 PM, credited the win to Brock Bowers' 33-point explosion and "definitely not luck, this was pure skill and roster management excellence." Meanwhile, Daniel Jones contributed 25 points while Drake Maye added 19, performances Bruce described as "validation for all those mock drafts I did in July while my kids played alone in the yard."

Sean, whose team featured stellar performances from Joe Flacco (37 points) and Justin Herbert (30 points) that ultimately meant nothing, spent the post-game period calculating how different defensive scoring adjustments in a parallel universe might have given him the victory. "If Garrett Wilson hadn't been out, and if Rhamondre Stevenson had played, and if the space-time continuum operated differently, I definitely win this," Sean explained to his uninterested coworkers Monday morning.

The loss drops Sean to what experts are calling "the purgatory zone" — too good to tank, too mediocre to compete, too invested to quit.

### Cal's Team Continues Dynasty of Excellence Nobody Asked For

Cal's Team maintained their position among the league's elite with a 125.5 to 107.5 victory over Joe's Team, powered by what analysts are calling "an unconscionable amount of points from players you've never heard of."

Caleb Williams erupted for 35 points while Drake London added 33, combining for more fantasy points than most people score on their SATs. Trevor Lawrence chipped in 22 points in what Cal described as "a perfectly orchestrated symphony of statistical dominance" and what his therapist described as "an unhealthy fixation on controlling outcomes in a fundamentally random universe."

"I've created a dynasty," Cal announced to his empty apartment, where championship banners from previous seasons hang next to a vision board that just says "VALIDATE ME" in 72-point font. "This is what peak performance looks like."

Joe, whose 107.5 points would have beaten half the league but instead resulted in another loss, saw solid contributions from Jacoby Brissett (27 points) and Rico Dowdle (25 points). "I scored over 100 points and lost," Joe said, in what witnesses described as "the same thing he says every week." Jonathan Taylor's zero-point performance has reportedly been added to Joe's "Reasons I Drink" spreadsheet, now in its 47th revision.

### Aaron's Team Stages Comeback Nobody Saw Because They Were Watching Actual Football

In a stunning turn of events that affected exactly twelve people's moods, Aaron's Team defeated Mitch's Team 95.0 to 91.5, despite what injury reports are calling "a roster held together with duct tape and false hope."

Jaxson Dart's 27-point performance proved that even broken clocks named after obscure quarterbacks are right twice a day, while Mark Andrews added 16 points in what Aaron called "a gutsy performance" and what medical professionals called "probably shouldn't have played."

Mitch, whose team featured more zeros than a binary code convention, watched in horror as Chuba Hubbard, George Kittle, Keenan Allen, and Xavier Legette combined for exactly zero points. "Brock Purdy was out, Cooper Kupp was out, Terry McLaurin was out," Mitch explained to anyone within earshot at his local Buffalo Wild Wings. "I basically fielded a team of ghosts and theoretical players."

The loss was particularly painful given Lamar Jackson's respectable 26 points and Michael Penix Jr.'s 21-point contribution. "Even when my good players show up, my bad players achieve a level of badness that shouldn't be mathematically possible," Mitch noted, before returning to his regular Tuesday activity of staring at the waiver wire like it owes him money.

### Dan's Team Defeats Eli's Team in Battle for Sixth Place Nobody Wanted

Dan's Team crushed Eli's Team 93.5 to 63.5 in what league officials are calling "a fight for mediocrity that somehow still had a clear winner."

Geno Smith led Dan's charge with 29 points, while Davante Adams contributed 19 points in his ongoing quest to be relevant on a fantasy team for the first time since 2021. "Travis Hunter being on IR hurts, but Hassan Haskins being out is really what's killing me," Dan said, demonstrating the kind of detailed roster knowledge that would be impressive if applied to literally any other pursuit.

Eli's team, devastated by Joe Mixon's absence and Joshua Palmer's mysterious disappearance from the realm of the living, managed just 63.5 points in what one observer called "a cry for help in statistical form." The performance included zeros from Matthew Golden and Darnell Mooney, who apparently decided that not catching passes was a form of performance art.

"I've now scored under 65 points twice this season," Eli revealed, "which my therapist says is 'concerning' but my fantasy football addiction counselor says is 'rock bottom.'"

### Pete's Team Edges Matt's Team 92.0 to 89.5 in Game That Time Forgot

Pete's Team defeated Matt's Team by 2.5 points in what historians are already calling "Week 9's third-least memorable matchup."

Matthew Stafford's 29 points and Jared Goff's 19 points powered Pete to victory, despite Brandon Aiyuk, Bucky Irving, D'Andre Swift, and Ricky Pearsall combining for fewer points than a circle. "I'm winning with half a roster," Pete proclaimed, apparently unaware that "winning" in fantasy football is like being the tallest building in Kansas.

Matt's team, crippled by A.J. Brown's absence and Isiah Pacheco's extended vacation on injured reserve, fought valiantly with Christian McCaffrey's 28 points and J.J. McCarthy's 18 points. "I was so close," Matt said, using the same phrase he uses to describe his relationship with happiness, success, and basic human fulfillment.

### League Enters "Desperation Zone" as Trade Deadline Approaches

As the league approaches its trade deadline, sources report that group chats have devolved into what psychologists are calling "a Lord of the Flies situation but with worse grammar."

"I've sent 47 trade offers this week," reported one anonymous owner. "All of them have been rejected with comments like 'lol no' and 'are you having a stroke?' But I remain optimistic that someone will eventually accept my package of three injured players for their RB1."

The league's injury report, which now requires its own dedicated server space, lists 17 players as "Out" and another 4 on Injured Reserve, leading to what one analyst called "a roster apocalypse that makes the actual apocalypse look manageable."

### Statistical Analysis Reveals Troubling Patterns

A deep dive into Week 9's numbers reveals several disturbing trends:

**The Elite Tier (110+ points):** Chris, Cal, Bruce, and Sean scored well enough to matter if this mattered, which it doesn't.

**The Mediocre Middle (90-110 points):** Joe, Aaron, Dan, Pete, and Mitch occupied what experts call "fantasy football purgatory" — too good to get high waiver priority, too bad to make the playoffs.

**The Basement Dwellers (Under 90 points):** Matt, Mike, and Eli have formed what sources describe as "a support group for people whose teams have betrayed them at a fundamental level."

The week's average score of 97.96 points suggests what statisticians are calling "a regression to the mean of human suffering."

### Looking Ahead to Week 10: Hope Dies Eternal

As the league prepares for Week 10, several key storylines are emerging:

- Will Mike's Team score more than 65 points? (Magic 8-Ball says: "Outlook not good")
- Can Mitch field a starting lineup without multiple zeros? (Historians say: "Doubtful")
- Will Chris's dominance continue or will karma finally catch up? (The universe says: "Karma doesn't exist in fantasy football")
- How many more players will join the injured reserve before owners admit this is affecting their mental health? (Therapists say: "All of them")

### Expert Opinion: "This League Should Have Folded in 2019"

Dr. Rebecca Martinez, a behavioral psychologist specializing in digital addiction, offered her professional assessment of the league: "These twelve individuals have created an elaborate framework to give meaning to randomized numerical outputs that have zero correlation with skill, strategy, or human worth. It's fascinating from a pathological perspective."

When asked if she had any advice for league members, Dr. Martinez simply said, "Have you considered taking up gardening? At least plants actually grow when you take care of them."

### In Memoriam: Players Who Scored Zero Points

The league would like to observe a moment of silence for the following players who contributed absolutely nothing to their teams' efforts: Chuba Hubbard, George Kittle, Keenan Allen, Xavier Legette, Samaje Perine, Tyrone Tracy Jr., Keon Coleman, Tyler Warren, Kyle Pitts Sr., Matthew Golden, Darnell Mooney, Jordan Addison, Rome Odunze, Tucker Kraft, Jahmyr Gibbs, Alvin Kamara, Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Tyjae Spears, Jonathan Taylor, and Xavier Worthy.

Their combined zero points serve as a reminder that in fantasy football, as in life, sometimes your best efforts amount to nothing and the universe doesn't care about your feelings.

### Final Thoughts: Why Are We Still Doing This?

As Week 9 concludes and Week 10 looms like a storm cloud made of false hope and statistical variance, one question remains: Why do twelve ostensibly intelligent adults continue to participate in an activity that brings them more pain than joy, more frustration than fulfillment, and more arguments about decimal scoring than any reasonable person should endure?

The answer, according to league sources, is "shut up, I'm trying to figure out if I should pick up the Dolphins defense or the Titans defense."

The league continues next week, despite overwhelming evidence that it shouldn't.
