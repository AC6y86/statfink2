# Week 11 Fantasy Football Recap: The Thanksgiving Dinner Table

## *Where Every Team is a Dish, and Someone's Casserole is Going in the Trash*

---

### Setting the Table

Gather 'round, fantasy faithful, because the family has arrived and it's time to eat. Week 11 brought us a spread that would make any grandma proud--and also deeply concerned about who raised some of these children. The dining room table is set for twelve, but let's be honest: some of these dishes are getting passed right over while others are being fought over like the last drumstick.

The league average for this week clocked in at a modest 90.5 points, well below our season average of 100.7 points. This was a week where the turkey came out dry for most families, but one team--ONE GLORIOUS TEAM--brought a bird so perfectly brined, so magnificently roasted, that everyone else's contributions looked like sad cafeteria leftovers. The standings are getting spicy as we approach playoff season, with nine-win juggernauts eyeing the championship while the basement dwellers are just hoping someone will eat their contribution out of pity.

## The Main Course: Chris's Team - The Golden Turkey (155.0 Points)

### *The centerpiece nobody can stop talking about*

Ladies and gentlemen, step aside and make room for THE TURKEY. Chris's Team didn't just win this week--they absolutely dominated the entire holiday gathering with a staggering 155.0 points that left everyone else at the table slack-jawed and reaching for their antacids. This wasn't just a win; this was a statement. This was Gordon Ramsay walking into a potluck and casually dropping a Michelin-star creation while everyone else brought store-bought rolls.

The star of this magnificent bird? Josh Allen, who carved up the competition with an absolutely MONSTROUS 48.0 fantasy points. Allen was the buttery, herb-crusted skin that everyone fights over--except there was plenty to go around because Chris's team was the only one feasting. But wait, the gravy was flowing too: Dak Prescott contributed a succulent 29.0 points, while rookie sensation TreVeyon Henderson added 27.0 points of perfectly seasoned stuffing. Even Jameson Williams (14.0), De'Von Achane (9.0), and Sam Darnold (9.0) showed up like delicious side helpings nobody expected.

The truly remarkable thing about this victory feast? Chris left points on the table! Josh Jacobs, Tony Pollard, RJ Harvey, Rome Odunze, and Rashee Rice all posted goose eggs. GOOSE. EGGS. Chris won by 76 points with half his roster laying eggs like it was Easter instead of Thanksgiving. That's the kind of dominance that has other managers checking the recipe book wondering what they're doing wrong. Eli's Team was the unfortunate dinner guest who had to sit across from this culinary masterpiece while nibbling on their own sad 79.0-point casserole, getting absolutely demolished in a matchup that was over before the first commercial break.

## The Matchup Breakdown: Dish by Dish

### Matchup 1: Chris's Team (155.0) vs. Eli's Team (79.0)
#### *Fine dining versus microwave leftovers*

We've already discussed the turkey, but let's pour one out for Eli's Team, who showed up to this dinner party with what can only be described as a dish best served... nowhere. The 79.0 points might have been respectable on another week, at another table, but against Chris? It was like bringing a Lunchable to a steakhouse.

Eli's biggest contributor was Kenneth Gainwell with 22.0 points--a perfectly adequate side dish that got completely overshadowed. Trey McBride added 17.0, and Patrick Mahomes managed only 14.0 points (the once-great chef having an off night). CeeDee Lamb scraped together 11.0 points, but the real tragedy was the bottom of Eli's roster: Amon-Ra St. Brown (0.0), David Montgomery (0.0), Tua Tagovailoa (0.0), Darnell Mooney (0.0), T.J. Hockenson (0.0), and more zeros than a sale at the dollar store. When your entire Lions stack puts up nothing because of a bye week, that's poor meal planning. Eli falls to 5-6 on the season, still clinging to playoff hopes but needing to seriously reconsider the menu.

### Matchup 2: Cal's Team (109.5) vs. Dan's Team (98.0)
#### *The underrated casserole steals the show*

Now HERE is a matchup worth discussing! Cal's Team came into this dinner party as that overlooked casserole in the corner--you know, the one Aunt Carol brought that everyone assumed would be mediocre but turned out to be the surprise hit of the evening. With 109.5 points, Cal secured a crucial victory over Dan's Team and their 98.0 points in a game that actually mattered for playoff positioning.

Bijan Robinson was Cal's star ingredient, a rich 25.0-point helping of pure running back excellence. The defense contributed 16.0 points (the seasoning that brings everything together), while Trevor Lawrence added 13.0 points of serviceable quarterback play. Drake London, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and Tyrone Tracy Jr. each contributed 9.0 points--solid role players who knew their assignments. The concern for Cal going forward? Ashton Jeanty, Emeka Egbuka, Dylan Sampson, and Kyle Pitts all posted zeros, but those are college players and bye-week casualties that don't carry over.

Dan's Team, meanwhile, was the dish that looked promising on the platter but ultimately disappointed. At 98.0 points, it wasn't terrible, but the distribution was all wrong. Kyren Williams led with just 14.0 points, followed by a quartet of players at 11.0 (Kenneth Walker III, Deebo Samuel, Geno Smith, and Marcus Mariota). Nobody dominated. Nobody stepped up to be the main course. And Saquon Barkley--SAQUON BARKLEY--managed just 6.0 points. That's like promising the family a honey-glazed ham and showing up with a hot dog. Dan drops to 4-7, and the playoff table is being cleared before they even got a seat.

### Matchup 3: Pete's Team (98.0) vs. Aaron's Team (60.0)
#### *Dependable comfort food takes down the burnt brussels sprouts*

Pete's Team is the mashed potatoes of this league: not flashy, not exciting, but consistently satisfying and always getting the job done. Their 98.0 points were buoyed almost entirely by Sean Tucker's electric 33.0-point performance--a rookie dish that had everyone asking for the recipe. Sean Tucker emerged from the kitchen like a Thanksgiving miracle, carrying Pete's roster on his back.

Supporting cast included Nico Collins (14.0), Jared Goff (14.0), and Travis Kelce (14.0)--a reliable trinity of proven veterans who show up every Thanksgiving and deliver exactly what you expect. Matthew Stafford chipped in 10.0, and D'Andre Swift added 6.0 for good measure. The concerning absences? Brandon Aiyuk and Sam LaPorta are both injured, leaving zeros on the table that Pete will need to address.

Aaron's Team, on the other hand, was the dish that nobody touched. At 60.0 points, this was the lowest score of the week--the vegetable medley that got pushed around the plate and ultimately scraped into the garbage disposal. Tetairoa McMillan tried valiantly with 25.0 points (a bright spot in an otherwise dim meal), but the supporting cast was abysmal. Mark Andrews and Bam Knight each contributed 8.0, but Zach Charbonnet (0.0) and Tank Bigsby (0.0) were no-shows. With Kyler Murray on IR, Aaron's Team is running on fumes and desperation. At 2-9, they're not just out of the playoffs--they're being asked to do the dishes while everyone else eats pie.

### Matchup 4: Mitch's Team (93.0) vs. Sean's Team (76.0)
#### *The surprise side dish outlasts the watered-down soup*

In a battle of two struggling squads, Mitch's Team managed to plate up 93.0 points against Sean's Team's disappointing 76.0. This wasn't a gourmet matchup--this was two relatives arguing over who brought the better store-bought contribution--but Mitch emerged victorious nonetheless.

Brock Purdy led the way with 21.0 points of savory quarterback play, while George Kittle added 19.0 points as the reliable tight end side dish that pairs perfectly with any main course. Xavier Legette surprised with 14.0 points, and Kareem Hunt contributed a workmanlike 11.0. Lamar Jackson, however, disappointed with just 6.0 points--the expensive ingredient that didn't deliver on its promise. The casualties were numerous: Chuba Hubbard (0.0), Brian Robinson Jr. (0.0), and Cooper Kupp (0.0) all failed to contribute a single morsel.

Sean's Team came up even shorter. Travis Etienne Jr. (19.0) and Devin Singletary (16.0) tried to carry the load, but when your wide receiver corps is led by Justin Jefferson with just 3.0 points, you're in trouble. Breece Hall (3.0), Jaylen Waddle (3.0), and Sterling Shepard (3.0) all contributed equally mediocre portions. This was a meal that filled nobody up. Sean drops to 3-8 and is officially eliminated from meaningful playoff conversation.

### Matchup 5: Joe's Team (91.0) vs. Mike's Team (65.5)
#### *Playoff positioning and the cold shoulder*

Joe's Team needed this win to stay in the two-horse race at the top, and they delivered just enough to secure it. At 91.0 points, this wasn't their most impressive performance, but it was sufficient to dispatch Mike's Team and their meager 65.5-point offering.

The secret ingredient? Jacoby Brissett with 25.0 points off the bench--the backup QB stepping in as the emergency appetizer that actually stole the show. George Pickens added 17.0 points of moody but talented receiver production, while Justin Fields (16.0) and James Cook III (11.0) provided the necessary depth. Jalen Hurts managed just 8.0 points, a concerning dip for a would-be QB1, but the win is what matters.

Mike's Team offered a bland 65.5-point dish that left everyone wanting more... or rather, wanting something else entirely. Baker Mayfield (13.0) and Jordan Love (12.0) were passable, but Jahmyr Gibbs managed only 9.0 points when more was expected. Tee Higgins contributed 11.0 before his injury designation took effect. The rest of the roster was a wasteland of zeros and disappointed hopes. Mike falls to 4-7, watching the playoff train pull away from the station without them aboard.

### Matchup 6: Matt's Team (94.0) vs. Bruce's Team (67.5)
#### *The comeback kid vs. the leftover surprise*

Matt's Team cooked up 94.0 points to handle Bruce's Team (67.5) in what became a showcase for Bryce Young's redemption arc. The former first-overall pick, written off as a bust by many, delivered 32.0 points--the dish that everyone had given up on but suddenly became the talk of the table. Sometimes the turkey nobody wanted becomes the star of the show.

Christian McCaffrey returned to form with 30.0 glorious points, proving that when healthy, he's still the premium cut of meat everyone covets. Derrick Henry added 17.0 points of steady, reliable production. The trio of Young, CMC, and Henry carried this roster to victory while A.J. Brown (0.0), DJ Moore (0.0), and DeVonta Smith (0.0) all sat out the meal entirely.

Bruce's Team brought what can only be described as a potluck disaster. Drake Maye (14.0) led the squad, followed by Bhayshul Tuten (11.0) and Bo Nix (9.0). When your leading scorer is a rookie quarterback and nobody cracks 15 points, you're serving lukewarm disappointment. Ja'Marr Chase (0.0), DK Metcalf (0.0), and Calvin Ridley (0.0) all failed to contribute, leaving Bruce's roster looking like a table full of empty serving dishes. Bruce falls to 6-5, still in the playoff mix but looking increasingly like a team that peaked at the appetizer course.

### The Solid Sides (Competitive Tier: 90-100 Points)

- **Pete's Team: 98.0** - Reliable mashed potatoes. Always delivers.
- **Matt's Team: 94.0** - The redemption dish. Bryce Young is the stuffing we didn't know we needed.
- **Mitch's Team: 93.0** - Adequate. Won't be remembered, won't be forgotten.
- **Joe's Team: 91.0** - Enough to win, not enough to impress.

### The Disappointing Dishes (Below Average: 70-90 Points)
- **Eli's Team: 79.0** - Suffered from too many bye weeks. Poor planning.

## The Bust Brigade: Who Let the Turkey Burn?

Several highly-paid chefs failed to deliver this week, leaving their owners hungry and disappointed:

- **Saquon Barkley (Dan's Team): 6.0 points** - The five-star ingredient that showed up as a side dish. Unacceptable.
- **Lamar Jackson (Mitch's Team): 6.0 points** - The reigning MVP cooked up nothing but confusion.
- **Justin Jefferson (Sean's Team): 3.0 points** - The premium wide receiver served burnt toast.
- **Ja'Marr Chase (Bruce's Team): 0.0 points** - Didn't even show up to the kitchen. Bye week blues.
- **Jahmyr Gibbs (Mike's Team): 9.0 points** - Expected the main course, got a sad little slider.

## Heartbreaks and Close Calls

The closest matchup of the week? Ironically, there weren't many nail-biters at this dinner table. The tightest was Cal vs. Dan at 11.5 points--a margin that could have swung with one more catch, one more touchdown, one different lineup decision. Dan's decision to start Aaron Rodgers (5.0) over other options may haunt him during leftovers week.

The most lopsided? Chris (155.0) absolutely demolishing Eli (79.0) by 76 points. That's not a matchup; that's a Thanksgiving dinner massacre. Eli's Team showed up with an empty casserole dish and wondered why nobody was eating.

## Looking Ahead: Playoff Implications

The table is nearly set for the playoff feast, and here's what we're watching:

**Locked In:** Chris's Team (9-2) and Joe's Team (9-2) have first-round byes virtually locked up. These two are the turkey AND the ham of this league--the main courses around which everything else revolves.

**Fighting for Scraps:** Matt (7-4), Cal (6-5), Bruce (6-5), and Pete (6-5) are all battling for the remaining playoff spots. Every win matters. Every casserole counts.

**Mathematically Alive, Spiritually Dead:** Eli (5-6) and Mitch (5-6) need help and hot streaks. Dan (4-7) and Mike (4-7) are on life support.

**Clean the Dishes and Go Home:** Sean (3-8) and Aaron (2-9) are playing for pride, draft position, and the right to say "wait 'til next year" without getting laughed out of the room.

*Happy Thanksgiving, fantasy managers. May your turkeys be golden, your matchups be favorable, and your opponents' star players be on bye weeks.*
