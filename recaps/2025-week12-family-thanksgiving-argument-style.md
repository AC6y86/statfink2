# Week 12 Fantasy Football Recap: The Family Thanksgiving Argument

## "PASS THE GRAVY AND YOUR PLAYOFF HOPES, UNCLE AARON"

*The annual gathering where everyone pretends they're fine but someone always ends up crying into the mashed potatoes*

---

### Setting the Scene: Grandma's House, 3:47 PM, Turkey Still in the Oven

The family has gathered once again around the oversized dining room table that Grandma insists seats twelve comfortably (it does not). The folding chairs from the garage have been deployed. Aunt Linda's questionable Jello salad sits untouched in the corner. And somewhere between the third glass of wine and Uncle Dan's seventh trip to "check on the game," the truth starts spilling out like cranberry sauce from a can that nobody actually asked for.

This week, the family fantasy league delivered exactly what you'd expect from a holiday gathering: one person won't stop bragging, two cousins nearly came to blows, and someone definitely should not have driven home. The average family member scored 94 points this week, but as we all know, nobody in this family is average, they're all either "doing amazing, thanks for asking" or "would've crushed it if the refs weren't blind."

Let the dysfunction begin.

### The Loud Uncle Who Won't Stop Bragging: Joe's 138.0-Point Feast

**Joe's Team (138.0) def. Aaron's Team (64.5)**

"DID EVERYONE SEE THAT? DID YOU SEE IT?" Joe bellowed from the head of the kids' table, turkey leg in one hand, phone showing his lineup in the other. "ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-EIGHT POINTS. That's a STATEMENT, people. That's not just winning, that's a message to the entire family!"

Uncle Joe came in absolutely swinging this Thanksgiving, posting a monstrous 138.0 points that obliterated Cousin Aaron by 73.5 points, the biggest blowout of the week. Jalen Hurts showed up like that one family member who actually brings a quality side dish, dropping 30.0 fantasy points of pure Philly dominance. Wan'Dale Robinson contributed 20.0 points, which is 20.0 more points than anyone expected, kind of like how nobody expected Aunt Linda's Jello salad to actually taste okay (it didn't, but we're being generous).

James Cook III and George Pickens both carved out 17.0-point performances, consistent contributors like the family members who just quietly set the table without being asked. Jacoby Brissett added 14.0 points off the bench, Jaylen Warren and Christian Kirk each kicked in 11.0 points, and even the defense contributed 8.0 points of supplementary domination.

Meanwhile, Cousin Aaron sat in stunned silence, poking at his sweet potato casserole, watching his entire roster lay eggs on national television. The poor kid mustered just 64.5 points, his highest contributor being Jakobi Meyers with a measly 11.0 points. Tetairoa McMillan, Zach Charbonnet, Jauan Jennings, and Bam Knight all tied at 8.0 points, like four cousins who all brought the exact same green bean casserole without coordinating.

"I WOULD'VE WON IF MARK ANDREWS DIDN'T HAVE A BYE," Aaron muttered into his napkin. Nobody had the heart to tell him that one player wasn't going to bridge a 73.5-point gap. At 2-10, Aaron's playoff hopes are deader than the turkey in the center of the table. Joe, meanwhile, climbs to 10-2, tied for first place in the standings, and won't let anyone forget it for the rest of the meal.

### The Sibling Rivalry Showdown: Cal vs. Bruce

**Cal's Team (124.5) def. Bruce's Team (63.0)**

If there's one matchup guaranteed to devolve into someone bringing up who mom loved more, it's Cal versus Bruce. These two have been at each other's throats since Cal allegedly broke Bruce's G.I. Joe in 1987, and nothing has changed.

Cal brought the heat like he was trying to prove something, posting 124.5 points behind the absolutely nuclear performance of Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who exploded for 28.0 points. "JSN! JSN! JSN!" Cal chanted, banging his fork on the table like a deranged auctioneer. Trevor Lawrence added 24.0 points, Caleb Williams contributed 21.0, and even rookie Ashton Jeanty kicked in a respectable 14.0.

Bruce, meanwhile, looked like a man who'd just discovered his retirement account was invested entirely in Beanie Babies. His team scraped together 63.0 points, with Daniel Jones leading the way at 16.0, which is exactly the kind of sentence that makes you want to lie down in traffic. Drake Maye added 14.0, Chase Brown contributed 9.0, and after that it was just tumbleweeds and broken dreams.

"At least I have REAL players, not a bunch of rookies," Bruce grumbled, gesturing vaguely at Cal's roster like a man grasping at straws. Cal just smiled, carved himself another piece of white meat, and let the scoreboard do the talking. Cal improves to 7-5 and firmly in the playoff picture, while Bruce falls to 6-6 and needs to start winning immediately if he wants to keep his postseason dreams alive.

### The Quiet Cousin Secretly Dominating: Chris's Strategic Mastery

**Chris's Team (79.5) def. Mitch's Team (53.0)**

While everyone was screaming at each other about politics and fantasy football (same thing, really), Cousin Chris quietly racked up his tenth win of the season. At 10-2, Chris is tied atop the standings with the loud uncle Joe, but you wouldn't know it from his demeanor. He just sat there, eating his turkey, occasionally checking his phone, smiling that unsettling smile of someone who knows they're going to win and doesn't need to tell everyone about it.

Dak Prescott led the charge with 30.0 points, because of course he did. Sam Darnold added 16.0 points in a very "Sam Darnold revenge game" kind of way, Rashee Rice contributed 11.0, and Josh Allen kicked in 9.0. Not flashy, but effective, like a sensible cardigan at a holiday gathering.

Mitch, on the other hand, had the kind of week that makes you wonder why we even play this game. His team limped to 53.0 points, with Kareem Hunt's 17.0 being the only real bright spot. Brock Purdy managed 11.0, but after that? Pain. Lamar Jackson put up a goose egg. Chuba Hubbard, Brian Robinson Jr., Cooper Kupp, Stefon Diggs, all zeros. It was like watching someone show up to Thanksgiving dinner with nothing but a half-empty bag of dinner rolls they picked up at a gas station.

"My whole team had BYES," Mitch insisted, gesturing wildly at nothing. Chris just nodded politely and asked if anyone wanted more gravy. At 5-7, Mitch's playoff hopes are hanging by a thread made of expired Christmas lights.

### The "We Don't Talk About That" Matchup: Dan vs. Pete

**Dan's Team (60.5) def. Pete's Team (54.0)**

This is the matchup nobody really wants to discuss, like that time Uncle Pete got too drunk at the 2019 Christmas party and said some things. Both teams showed up looking like they'd rather be literally anywhere else, combining for just 114.5 points in what can only be described as "technically a football game."

Dan's victory came down to Davante Adams (19.0 points) and Geno Smith (14.0), which sounds impressive until you realize his third-highest scorer was Khalil Shakir with 9.0 points, followed by kicker Brandon McManus with 7.0. After that, the cupboard was bare. Kenneth Walker III, Zay Flowers, and Saquon Barkley all managed just 3.0 points each, like triplets who all decided to disappoint their parents equally.

Pete's squad was even more dire. Matthew Stafford and Jared Goff combined for 43.0 points, which sounds good until you realize that represented nearly 80% of his team's output. After the two quarterbacks, his highest scorer was, let me check my notes, two kickers tied at 5.0 points each. Nico Collins and Woody Marks both managed just 3.0 points, and everyone else had the audacity to not show up at all.

"I had five players on bye," Pete claimed, which is the fantasy football equivalent of saying your dog ate your homework. Dan moves to 5-7, still technically alive for the playoffs if you squint. Pete falls to 6-6, which sounds respectable until you remember he's been 6-6 for what feels like three consecutive seasons.

### The Kid Who Brought a Date No One Approved Of: Mike vs. Sean

**Mike's Team (98.5) def. Sean's Team (67.0)**

This matchup was all about one man: Jahmyr Gibbs. Mike showed up to Thanksgiving dinner with Gibbs on his arm, and Gibbs proceeded to charm every single member of the family with his 39.0-point performance. Grandma loved him. The kids loved him. Even grumpy Uncle Bruce nodded approvingly from across the room.

"THIRTY-NINE POINTS FROM ONE PLAYER," Mike announced, as if we hadn't all been watching it happen in real time. Quinshon Judkins added 16.0 points, Harrison Butker kicked in 10.0, the defense contributed 10.0, and suddenly Mike had a comfortable 98.5-point victory despite Baker Mayfield only managing 5.0 points and Alvin Kamara, Jordan Love, and Tee Higgins all sitting out with zeros.

Sean's response was basically to shrug and reach for the wine bottle. Cam Ward tried his best with 22.0 points, Travis Etienne added 14.0, and Joe Flacco plus Parker Washington each contributed 11.0. But Justin Jefferson posted a donut. Rhamondre Stevenson posted a donut. Devin Singletary? Donut. It was a bakery of disappointment over there.

At 3-9, Sean's playoff hopes require a mathematical scenario so complex that NASA would need to get involved. Mike climbs to 5-7 and keeps his faint postseason dreams alive, mostly because Jahmyr Gibbs is a literal cheat code.

### The One Who Shows Up Late and Still Wins: Matt's Clutch Victory

**Matt's Team (101.5) def. Eli's Team (71.0)**

Matt arrived at Thanksgiving dinner fifteen minutes late, didn't apologize, grabbed a plate, and proceeded to win his fantasy matchup by 30.5 points while everyone else was still arguing about whether the turkey was dry. It was infuriating in the way only Matt can be infuriating.

His victory was built on a four-headed monster: Derrick Henry (19.0), DJ Moore (19.0), Christian McCaffrey (17.0), and A.J. Brown (17.0). That's 72 points from four players, which is more than Eli's entire roster produced. Andy Borregales, the kicker, quietly added 9.0 points, and Michael Pittman Jr. contributed 8.0 for good measure.

Eli, meanwhile, looked like someone had replaced his meal with cardboard. Amon-Ra St. Brown's 17.0 points was solid, and Patrick Mahomes contributed 14.0, but after that the wheels fell completely off the stuffing wagon. Darnell Mooney managed 11.0, CeeDee Lamb and Trey McBride each had 6.0, and David Montgomery, who was supposed to be a centerpiece, put up a fat zero.

"I had a good team! MAHOMES! ST. BROWN! LAMB!" Eli protested, his voice rising with each name. Nobody had the heart to tell him that good teams don't score 71 points. Matt improves to 8-4 and cements his playoff position, while Eli drops to 5-7 and will need to win out to have any chance at postseason glory.

### Performance Tiers: Who Gets Dessert First

**The Elite Table (100+ points):**
- Joe's Team: 138.0 points (gets the good pie)
- Cal's Team: 124.5 points (gets the slightly smaller piece)
- Matt's Team: 101.5 points (barely made the cut, gets pumpkin)

**The "We Tried" Middle (70-99 points):**
- Mike's Team: 98.5 points (Gibbs doing all the heavy lifting)
- Chris's Team: 79.5 points (efficient, if uninspiring)
- Eli's Team: 71.0 points (Mahomes deserved better)

**The "What Happened?" Basement (Below 70):**
- Sean's Team: 67.0 points (Jefferson's zero hurts)
- Aaron's Team: 64.5 points (everything hurts)
- Bruce's Team: 63.0 points (Daniel Jones was the BEST player)
- Dan's Team: 60.5 points (but hey, he won!)
- Pete's Team: 54.0 points (two QBs, still lost)
- Mitch's Team: 53.0 points (Lamar Jackson's zero is a tragedy)

### The Bust Brigade: Who Gets Coal in Their Stocking

The following players showed up to Thanksgiving dinner, ate all the good food, and contributed absolutely nothing to the family:

- **Lamar Jackson (Mitch):** 0.0 points. LAMAR. JACKSON. ZERO.
- **Saquon Barkley (Dan):** 3.0 points from an MVP candidate. Yikes.
- **Jonathan Taylor (Joe):** 3.0 points, but Joe won by 73 so who cares
- **Kenneth Walker III (Dan):** 3.0 points, adding to Dan's misery
- **CeeDee Lamb (Eli):** 6.0 points from a first-round pick. Pain.
- **Justin Jefferson (Sean):** 0.0 points. THE BEST RECEIVER IN FOOTBALL.
- **Travis Kelce (Pete):** 0.0 points. Age comes for us all.

---

### Close Calls and Heartbreaks

The tightest matchup of the week was Dan vs. Pete, decided by just 6.5 points. If Pete's D'Andre Swift had shown up instead of posting a zero, this could have been different. If Travis Kelce remembered how to catch a football, this could have been different. Instead, Dan walks away with a win he absolutely did not deserve, and Pete is left wondering why he even bothers.

### Looking Ahead: Who Gets Invited Back Next Year

With just weeks remaining, the playoff picture is becoming clearer:

**Locked In:** Chris (10-2) and Joe (10-2) have clinched their spots at the adult table.

**Looking Good:** Matt (8-4) and Cal (7-5) are well-positioned for postseason glory.

**Sweating Bullets:** Pete (6-6), Bruce (6-6), Dan (5-7), Mitch (5-7), Mike (5-7), and Eli (5-7) are all packed into a six-way race for the remaining spots.

**Mathematically Alive But Emotionally Dead:** Sean (3-9) and Aaron (2-10) should probably start planning for next year.

*Happy Thanksgiving, you dysfunctional degenerates. See you next week when someone inevitably brings up that trade from Week 4 that "ruined the league."*
