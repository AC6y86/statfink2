# The Thanksgiving Reckoning: Week 11 Fantasy Football Recap

## A Tale of Blessings and Curses

As the leaves fall and families gather around tables laden with turkey and stuffing, our fantasy football league experienced its own version of Thanksgiving -- some owners feasted like kings while others picked at the cold scraps of disappointment. Week 11 brought us triumphs that deserve their own parade floats and disasters that belong in the garbage disposal alongside Aunt Edna's attempt at cranberry sauce.

The average team scored a modest 90.5 points this week, well below the season average of around 95 points. This was a week of extremes -- elite performances from a select few and absolute catastrophes from the rest. Let us give thanks... and air our grievances.

## THE MATCHUPS: WHO'S GIVING THANKS, WHO'S GIVING UP

---

### MATCHUP 1: Chris's Team (155.0) vs Eli's Team (79.0)

**THE ABSOLUTE DEMOLITION**

#### Chris's Thanksgiving Feast

**BLESSINGS COUNTED: 5**

Chris didn't just win this week -- he put on a clinic that should be studied in fantasy football academies. The crown jewel? **Josh Allen with an absolutely MONSTROUS 48.0 points**. That's not a typo. Forty-eight points from a single quarterback. Josh Allen was throwing touchdowns like Chris's relatives throw shade at Thanksgiving dinner, and the result was pure fantasy gold.

But wait, there's more gravy on this plate! **Dak Prescott** chipped in 29.0 points as Chris's QB2 (yes, he has the luxury of a QB2 putting up starter numbers). **TreVeyon Henderson** rumbled for 27.0 points, giving Chris a running game that rivals any NFL team. **Jameson Williams** added 14.0 points, and even **De'Von Achane** contributed a respectable 9.0 points despite Miami's struggles.

Chris is thankful for:
1. Josh Allen being Josh Allen (48.0 points)
2. Having multiple starting-caliber QBs
3. TreVeyon Henderson's breakout performance
4. Eli having the worst possible week to face him
5. Standing at 9-2 atop the league

**GRIEVANCES LOGGED: 2**

Even in victory, there are thorns among the roses. **Josh Jacobs**, **Tony Pollard**, **RJ Harvey**, **Rome Odunze**, and **Rashee Rice** all combined for a grand total of... ZERO POINTS. That's five players contributing nothing to the scoreboard. If Chris had needed those points, this would be a very different story. He's unthankful for carrying dead weight, even if it didn't matter this week.

Chris is unthankful for:
1. Five players scoring exactly 0.0 points
2. The Rams and Buccaneers defenses being useless

---

#### Eli's Thanksgiving Tragedy

**BLESSINGS COUNTED: 2**

Poor Eli. Finding things to be thankful for this week is like finding a vegetarian option at a Texas BBQ. **Kenneth Gainwell** showed up with 22.0 points, proving that sometimes backup running backs can be league winners. **Trey McBride** added 17.0 points from the tight end position, which is genuinely elite production for a position that usually delivers disappointment.

Eli is thankful for:
1. Kenneth Gainwell's surprise 22.0 point outburst
2. Trey McBride being a TE1

**GRIEVANCES LOGGED: 8**

Where do we even begin? **Amon-Ra St. Brown** -- the Sun God himself -- scored ZERO POINTS. **David Montgomery**? Zero. **Tua Tagovailoa**? Zero. **T.J. Hockenson**? Zero. **Darnell Mooney**? Zero. **Matthew Golden**? Zero. **Joshua Palmer**? Zero. The Chiefs DST? ZERO.

Eli is unthankful for:
1. Eight players scoring exactly 0.0 points
2. The Sun God going dark (Amon-Ra St. Brown: 0.0)
3. David Montgomery being MIA
4. Tua Tagovailoa's disappearing act
5. Facing Josh Allen's 48-point explosion
6. Being 5-6 and fighting for playoff survival
7. T.J. Hockenson's complete absence
8. A 76-point loss that crushes the soul

---

### MATCHUP 2: Mitch's Team (93.0) vs Sean's Team (76.0)

**THE BATTLE OF MEDIOCRITY**

#### Mitch's Modest Thanksgiving

**BLESSINGS COUNTED: 4**

Mitch scraped together 93.0 points, which sounds okay until you realize the entire 49ers offense was carrying his team. **Brock Purdy** (21.0) and **George Kittle** (19.0) combined for 40 points from the San Francisco connection. **Xavier Legette** emerged with 14.0 points, proving that the Panthers can occasionally produce fantasy-relevant players. **Kareem Hunt** quietly added 11.0 points of veteran production.

Mitch is thankful for:
1. The entire 49ers offense (Purdy + Kittle = 40 points)
2. Xavier Legette's breakout game
3. Sean's team being worse
4. Climbing to 5-6 with playoff hopes alive

**GRIEVANCES LOGGED: 5**

The zero-point parade continues! **Chuba Hubbard**, **Brian Robinson Jr.**, and **Cooper Kupp** all posted goose eggs. For a team that needs consistency, having three rostered players provide nothing is unacceptable. **Lamar Jackson** -- the reigning MVP -- managed only 6.0 points. That's criminal underperformance from a top-5 draft pick.

Mitch is unthankful for:
1. Lamar Jackson's pathetic 6.0 points
2. Chuba Hubbard scoring 0.0
3. Brian Robinson Jr. being invisible
4. Cooper Kupp's continued struggles (0.0 points)
5. Michael Penix Jr. on IR with a torn ACL

---

#### Sean's Soggy Turkey

**BLESSINGS COUNTED: 2**

**Travis Etienne Jr.** finally remembered he's a starting NFL running back and posted 19.0 points. **Devin Singletary** added 16.0 points, giving Sean a competent backfield performance. That's... that's about it for the good news.

Sean is thankful for:
1. Travis Etienne Jr.'s 19.0 point revival
2. Devin Singletary's solid 16.0 points

**GRIEVANCES LOGGED: 7**

**Justin Herbert** -- the supposed franchise quarterback -- posted a fat ZERO. How does a starting NFL quarterback score zero points? **Justin Jefferson**, the consensus WR1 in most leagues, managed a paltry 3.0 points. **Breece Hall** also scored just 3.0 points. The 49ers and Jets defenses combined for ZERO. This is a 3-8 team playing like it, and Sean should be unthankful for just about everything.

Sean is unthankful for:
1. Justin Herbert's 0.0 points
2. Justin Jefferson's embarrassing 3.0 points
3. Breece Hall's invisible 3.0 point effort
4. Being 3-8 and mathematically toast
5. Two defenses combining for 0.0 points
6. The entire Chargers offense failing him
7. Looking at another lost season

---

### MATCHUP 3: Dan's Team (98.0) vs Cal's Team (109.5)

**THE COMPETITIVE CLASH**

#### Cal's Cornucopia

**BLESSINGS COUNTED: 5**

Cal brought home the W with a balanced attack that any Thanksgiving host would envy. **Bijan Robinson** was the main course with 25.0 points of elite running back production. The **Steelers DST** feasted for 16.0 points -- because nothing says Thanksgiving like watching the Pittsburgh defense devour opposing offenses. **Trevor Lawrence** contributed 13.0 points, while **Drake London**, **Jaxon Smith-Njigba**, and **Tyrone Tracy Jr.** each added 9.0 points. Even the kicker, **Jason Myers**, chipped in 8.5 points.

Cal is thankful for:
1. Bijan Robinson being a bonafide RB1 (25.0 points)
2. The Steelers defense dominating (16.0 points)
3. Depth scoring across multiple positions
4. Climbing to 6-5 and playoff contention
5. Trevor Lawrence's steady 13.0 points

**GRIEVANCES LOGGED: 6**

The zero parade marches on! **Ashton Jeanty**, the Heisman candidate turned NFL rookie, scored 0.0 points. **Emeka Egbuka**, **Dylan Sampson**, **Kyle Pitts Sr.**, the Commanders DST, and **Isaiah Davis** all contributed nothing. That's six roster spots producing absolutely zilch. Cal won despite this dead weight, not because of it.

Cal is unthankful for:
1. Ashton Jeanty's goose egg (0.0 points)
2. Kyle Pitts continuing to disappoint
3. Six players scoring exactly 0.0 points
4. The Commanders defense being useless
5. Emeka Egbuka's invisible performance
6. Carrying too many boom-or-bust rookies

---

#### Dan's Decent Effort

**BLESSINGS COUNTED: 4**

Dan put up a respectable 98.0 points in a losing effort. **Kyren Williams** led the charge with 14.0 points, followed by a trio of 11.0-point performances from **Kenneth Walker III**, **Deebo Samuel**, and **Geno Smith**. **Marcus Mariota** also contributed 11.0 points as a backup QB getting run. The **Browns DST** added 8.0 points.

Dan is thankful for:
1. Consistency across multiple starters
2. Kyren Williams' solid 14.0 points
3. Geno Smith providing QB stability
4. The Browns defense showing up (8.0 points)

**GRIEVANCES LOGGED: 5**

The heartbreak of falling 11.5 points short stings, especially when you look at who failed. **Blake Corum**, **Khalil Shakir**, and **Raheem Mostert** all scored 0.0 points. **Saquon Barkley** -- the crown jewel of many drafts -- managed only 6.0 points. For a guy going in the first round, that's not going to cut it.

Dan is unthankful for:
1. Losing by 11.5 points in a close game
2. Saquon Barkley's disappointing 6.0 points
3. Blake Corum's invisible performance
4. Falling to 4-7 and playoff elimination territory
5. Three players combining for 0.0 points

---

### MATCHUP 4: Pete's Team (98.0) vs Aaron's Team (60.0)

**THE COMFORTABLE CRUISE**

#### Pete's Plentiful Portions

**BLESSINGS COUNTED: 4**

Pete rode the **Sean Tucker** express to victory, with the Tampa Bay running back exploding for 33.0 points. That's RB1 overall production from a guy who probably cost nothing on waivers. **Nico Collins**, **Jared Goff**, and **Travis Kelce** all contributed 14.0 points apiece, giving Pete three reliable starters all hitting the same number like it was scripted. **Matthew Stafford** added 10.0 points.

Pete is thankful for:
1. Sean Tucker's EXPLOSIVE 33.0 point game
2. Travis Kelce proving he's still elite (14.0 points)
3. Nico Collins returning to form (14.0 points)
4. Jared Goff's consistent 14.0 points
5. Moving to 6-5 in the playoff hunt

**GRIEVANCES LOGGED: 5**

Despite the win, Pete's roster is bleeding. **Ricky Pearsall**, **Ray Davis**, **Woody Marks**, **Zach Ertz**, and both the Broncos and Chargers defenses combined for ZERO points. That's a lot of dead roster spots. Plus, **Brandon Aiyuk** remains on the injury report (Out), and **Sam LaPorta** is on IR with a back injury that might end his season. The wins are coming, but the injuries are mounting.

Pete is unthankful for:
1. Six roster spots producing 0.0 points
2. Brandon Aiyuk being OUT
3. Sam LaPorta on IR for the season
4. Inconsistent depth production
5. Carrying two defenses that both scored zero

---

#### Aaron's Awful Afternoon

**BLESSINGS COUNTED: 1**

Look, we're really digging deep here. **Tetairoa McMillan** delivered 25.0 points, which is genuinely excellent. The rookie wide receiver was the lone bright spot in an otherwise dismal performance. That's it. That's the only blessing.

Aaron is thankful for:
1. Tetairoa McMillan's excellent 25.0 points

**GRIEVANCES LOGGED: 8**

At 2-9, Aaron's team is a Thanksgiving disaster of epic proportions. **Zach Charbonnet** scored 0.0. **Tank Bigsby** scored 0.0. The **Cardinals DST** scored 0.0. **Kyler Murray** remains on IR, leaving Aaron without his QB1. The remaining players -- **Mark Andrews** (8.0), **Bam Knight** (8.0), **Javonte Williams** (6.0), **Chase McLaughlin** (5.0), **Jauan Jennings** (3.0), **Jakobi Meyers** (3.0), and the **Cowboys DST** (2.0) -- were aggressively mediocre.

Aaron is unthankful for:
1. Kyler Murray on Injured Reserve
2. Being 2-9 and mathematically eliminated
3. Three players scoring 0.0 points
4. Starting players who are barely rosterable
5. The Cardinals defense being useless
6. Only one player breaking 10 points
7. Looking at the longest offseason in the league
8. The 38-point margin of defeat

---

### MATCHUP 5: Joe's Team (91.0) vs Mike's Team (65.5)

**THE WORKMANLIKE WIN**

#### Joe's Just Enough

**BLESSINGS COUNTED: 4**

Joe won ugly, but a win is a win. **Jacoby Brissett** -- yes, THAT Jacoby Brissett -- put up 25.0 points in what might be the most unexpected fantasy performance of the week. **George Pickens** added 17.0 points, while **Justin Fields** contributed 16.0 points as a QB2. **James Cook** rounded out the double-digit scorers with 11.0 points.

Joe is thankful for:
1. Jacoby Brissett's shocking 25.0 point explosion
2. George Pickens' 17.0 point effort
3. Justin Fields providing QB depth (16.0 points)
4. Standing at 9-2, tied for first place

**GRIEVANCES LOGGED: 6**

Despite the win, Joe's roster had some concerning holes. **Ladd McConkey**, **Xavier Worthy**, **Christian Kirk**, the Patriots DST, **Wan'Dale Robinson**, **Dallas Goedert**, and **Cade Otton** ALL scored 0.0 points. That's SEVEN players contributing nothing. Joe won because Mike was worse, not because his own team was good.

Joe is unthankful for:
1. SEVEN players scoring 0.0 points
2. Ladd McConkey's invisible game
3. Xavier Worthy continuing to disappoint
4. Both tight ends scoring 0.0
5. The Patriots defense being worthless
6. Winning despite his roster, not because of it

---

#### Mike's Miserable Monday

**BLESSINGS COUNTED: 2**

**Baker Mayfield** (13.0) and **Jordan Love** (12.0) gave Mike competent quarterback production. **Tee Higgins** contributed 11.0 points, though he's now listed as OUT with a concussion. That's... that's about it for the highlights.

Mike is thankful for:
1. Baker Mayfield's steady 13.0 points
2. Jordan Love's solid 12.0 points

**GRIEVANCES LOGGED: 7**

The bottom of Mike's roster is a graveyard. **Jacory Croskey-Merritt**, **Tyjae Spears**, **Mason Taylor**, the Packers DST, the Bills DST, **Oronde Gadsden II**, **Tez Johnson**, and **Emari Demercado** combined for ZERO points. That's EIGHT players who might as well have not shown up. **Tee Higgins** is now OUT, adding injury to insult.

Mike is unthankful for:
1. EIGHT players scoring 0.0 points
2. Tee Higgins being OUT with a concussion
3. Falling to 4-7 and playoff elimination
4. Both defenses being worthless
5. Carrying too many non-productive players
6. Jahmyr Gibbs only managing 9.0 points
7. The depth of roster dysfunction

---

### MATCHUP 6: Bruce's Team (67.5) vs Matt's Team (94.0)

**THE BOTTOM FEEDER BATTLE**

#### Matt's Modest Feast

**BLESSINGS COUNTED: 4**

Matt won this one thanks to **Bryce Young** -- yes, THAT Bryce Young -- putting up 32.0 points. The former bust quarterback is apparently fantasy-relevant again? **Christian McCaffrey** reminded everyone why he was the overall RB1 pick with 30.0 points. **Derrick Henry** added 17.0 points of his usual reliable production.

Matt is thankful for:
1. Bryce Young's SHOCKING 32.0 point resurrection
2. Christian McCaffrey being CMC (30.0 points)
3. Derrick Henry's consistent 17.0 points
4. Moving to 7-4 with solid playoff positioning

**GRIEVANCES LOGGED: 6**

The zeroes strike again! **A.J. Brown**, **DJ Moore**, **DeVonta Smith**, **Jerome Ford**, **Rashid Shaheed**, the Lions DST, and the Dolphins DST all scored 0.0 points. That's SEVEN roster spots producing nothing. Matt won on the backs of three players while the rest of his team slept. **Justice Hill** being OUT doesn't help either.

Matt is unthankful for:
1. SEVEN players scoring 0.0 points
2. A.J. Brown's complete disappearance
3. DJ Moore's invisible game
4. DeVonta Smith going dark
5. Both defenses being useless
6. Justice Hill being OUT

---

#### Bruce's Burnt Bird

**BLESSINGS COUNTED: 2**

**Drake Maye** led Bruce's squad with 14.0 points, showing flashes of his rookie potential. **Bhayshul Tuten** added 11.0 points. Beyond that, Bruce was scraping the bottom of the barrel.

Bruce is thankful for:
1. Drake Maye's promising 14.0 points
2. Bhayshul Tuten's 11.0 point contribution

**GRIEVANCES LOGGED: 9**

Sweet mercy, where to begin? **Ja'Marr Chase** -- the premium WR1 -- scored 0.0 points. **DK Metcalf**, **Calvin Ridley** (now on IR), **Nick Chubb**, **Jerry Jeudy**, **Marquise Brown**, **Kyle Juszczyk**, and the Texans DST all scored ZERO. That's EIGHT players contributing nothing. **Brock Bowers** managed only 3.0 points.

Bruce is unthankful for:
1. Ja'Marr Chase scoring 0.0 points
2. DK Metcalf's disappearing act (0.0)
3. Calvin Ridley on IR with a fibula injury
4. Nick Chubb scoring 0.0
5. EIGHT players with goose eggs
6. Brock Bowers' pathetic 3.0 points
7. The 26.5-point margin of defeat
8. Sitting at 6-5 with a team in shambles
9. Jerry Jeudy continuing to disappoint

## THE HEADLINER: JOSH ALLEN'S GODLIKE PERFORMANCE

Josh Allen didn't just have a good week -- he had a week that should be framed and hung in the Fantasy Football Hall of Fame. His 48.0 points represent the kind of single-player performance that wins matchups by itself. Chris could have started Josh Allen and 18 mannequins and still would have outscored half the league.

To put this in perspective: Josh Allen scored more points than the ENTIRE TEAMS of Aaron (60.0), Mike (65.5), Bruce (67.5), and Sean (76.0). One player. More than four whole rosters. That's not fantasy football -- that's fantasy dominance.

---

## PERFORMANCE TIERS

### The Elite (100+ points)
- **Chris's Team: 155.0** - Josh Allen carried them to the stratosphere
- **Cal's Team: 109.5** - Balanced attack with Bijan leading the way

### The Competent (90-99 points)
- **Dan's Team: 98.0** - Solid but not enough
- **Pete's Team: 98.0** - Sean Tucker's emergence saved the day
- **Matt's Team: 94.0** - Bryce Young and CMC did all the work
- **Mitch's Team: 93.0** - 49ers stack delivered
- **Joe's Team: 91.0** - Won despite seven zeroes

### The Struggling (75-89 points)
- **Eli's Team: 79.0** - Sun God went dark, team followed
- **Sean's Team: 76.0** - Justin Herbert and Jefferson both failed

### The Basement (Under 75 points)
- **Bruce's Team: 67.5** - Ja'Marr Chase leading the bust parade
- **Mike's Team: 65.5** - Eight players scored zero
- **Aaron's Team: 60.0** - 2-9 and counting down to next year

---

## THE BUST BRIGADE: STARS WHO FAILED THEIR OWNERS

The fantasy gods giveth, and the fantasy gods taketh away. This week, they took away with EXTREME prejudice:

1. **Amon-Ra St. Brown** (0.0 points) - The Sun God experienced a total solar eclipse
2. **Ja'Marr Chase** (0.0 points) - The WR1 went completely dark
3. **Saquon Barkley** (6.0 points) - First-round pick, sixth-round production
4. **Justin Herbert** (0.0 points) - Chargers gonna Charge
5. **Justin Jefferson** (3.0 points) - The supposed best WR in football
6. **Lamar Jackson** (6.0 points) - MVP? Not this week
7. **Josh Jacobs** (0.0 points) - Packers feature back feature-less
8. **A.J. Brown** (0.0 points) - Philly's WR1 was a ghost

---

## CLOSE CALLS & HEARTBREAKS

The closest matchup of the week was **Mitch (93.0) vs Sean (76.0)** -- a 17-point differential that doesn't quite qualify as a nail-biter but shows how quickly things can change when one player goes off or busts.

The real heartbreak belongs to **Dan**, who put up a respectable 98.0 points only to lose to Cal's 109.5. Sometimes you play well and still lose. That's fantasy football.

---

## LOOKING AHEAD: PLAYOFF IMPLICATIONS

The playoff picture is crystallizing:

**LOCKS:**
- **Chris's Team (9-2)** - Clinched or close to it
- **Joe's Team (9-2)** - Tied for first, looking strong

**IN THE HUNT:**
- **Matt's Team (7-4)** - Solid positioning
- **Cal's Team (6-5)** - Needs to keep winning
- **Bruce's Team (6-5)** - Roster is concerning
- **Pete's Team (6-5)** - Injuries could derail things

**NEED A MIRACLE:**
- **Eli's Team (5-6)** - Must win out
- **Mitch's Team (5-6)** - Same boat as Eli

**MATHEMATICALLY CHALLENGED:**
- **Dan's Team (4-7)** - Would need significant help
- **Mike's Team (4-7)** - Ditto

**ALREADY PLANNING FOR 2026:**
- **Sean's Team (3-8)** - It's over
- **Aaron's Team (2-9)** - The rebuild starts now

## FINAL THANKSGIVING THOUGHTS

This week taught us that fantasy football is truly a game of feast or famine. While Chris carved up the competition with Josh Allen's 48-point feast, others like Aaron (60.0), Mike (65.5), and Bruce (67.5) were left picking at scraps.

The injury bug continues to bite, the zeros continue to accumulate, and the playoff race continues to tighten. As we head into the final stretch of the regular season, remember: in fantasy football, as in Thanksgiving, the key is to surround yourself with reliable performers and avoid inviting the cousins who always cause drama.

Happy Thanksgiving, and may your fantasy rosters be blessed with touchdowns and devoid of goose eggs.

---

*Week 11 is in the books. The Thanksgiving Reckoning has arrived. Some will feast, some will fast, and Aaron will already be planning his 2026 draft strategy.*
