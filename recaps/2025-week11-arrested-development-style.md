# Week 11: The One Where Chris Made a Huge Mistake
*An Arrested Development-Style Fantasy Football Recap*

---

## "Now the story of a fantasy football league that lost everything, and the one owner who had no choice but to keep them all together..."

*Narrator: On the next Arrested Development...*

Actually, no. This is happening right now. Week 11 of the 2025 fantasy football season, where twelve grown men continue to make decisions that would embarrass a child with a Magic 8-Ball. 

*He means the fantasy owners, not actual children.*

It was a week that saw the league's average score plummet to 90.5 points, a number so depressing that even the league's therapist—there isn't one, but there should be—would need therapy. The highest score of 155 belonged to Chris, who, despite dominating like a Bluth at a charity auction where the charity is themselves, still somehow managed to look vulnerable. The lowest? Aaron's 60 points, a score so embarrassing it made GOB's magic career look legitimate.

*It wasn't.*

## "I've Made a Huge Mistake" - The Aaron's Team Story

*Meanwhile, at Aaron's compound...*

Aaron (2-9) had assembled what he thought was a competent roster. Three of his quarterbacks were injured. 

*Narrator: They were ALL injured.*

Jayden Daniels? Out. Kyler Murray? On injured reserve since someone looked at him wrong. Marvin Harrison Jr.? His appendix had apparently decided to pursue other opportunities. The only thing more damaged than Aaron's roster was his pride, though that had been gone since Week 3.

*It was actually Week 2.*

Tetairoa McMillan managed to salvage some dignity with 25 points, performing like a Michael Bluth in a family of Busters. But when your team scores 60 points—the equivalent of showing up to a black-tie event in a $3,000 suit wearing flip-flops—even your best player can't save you from the shame.

*COME ON!*

Aaron lost to Pete 98-60, a margin so wide you could fit the Bluth Company's actual profits in it.

*Those profits were zero.*

## "There's Always Points in the Josh Allen Stand" - Chris's Masterclass

*Earlier that day...*

Chris (9-2) had done what Chris does best: accidentally succeed despite himself. His team posted 155 points, the kind of score that makes other owners wonder if they're playing the same game. Josh Allen threw for 48 points, a performance so dominant it made the other quarterbacks look like they were playing with their weak hand.

*Most of them effectively were.*

"I knew Josh Allen would deliver," Chris said, in the same tone George Sr. used when claiming he knew the SEC wasn't going to find those documents.

*They found them.*

Dak Prescott added 29 points, because apparently having one elite quarterback wasn't showing off enough. TreVeyon Henderson contributed 27, turning Chris's roster into what financial advisors would call "diversified" and what everyone else would call "annoyingly good."

Meanwhile, Eli (5-6) managed just 79 points against Chris's onslaught. Kenneth Gainwell's 22 points was admirable, like Tobias getting a callback.

*He didn't get the part.*

CeeDee Lamb, supposedly an elite receiver, managed just 11 points, performing with all the reliability of the Bluth Company's construction projects. Trey McBride added 17, which in any other matchup might have mattered. Here, it was like bringing a knife to a Josh Allen fight.

*The knife would lose. Obviously.*

## "Her?" - The Mitch vs. Sean Confusion

Mitch (5-6) faced Sean (3-8) in what the league was calling "The Battle for Ninth Place."

*It wasn't actually for ninth place. The narrator is being cruel.*

Mitch emerged with a 93-76 victory, though "emerged" suggests more dignity than what actually occurred. Brock Purdy managed 21 points, performing like a Bluth family member who actually went to college. George Kittle added 19, catching passes with the determination of someone who knew Cooper Kupp—sitting on the same roster with 0 points—had given up entirely.

*He had. Weeks ago.*

But the real tragedy was Michael Penix Jr., who tore his ACL and landed on injured reserve, joining Cam Skattebo in what Mitch was calling his "Island of Misfit Quarterbacks."

*It was actually just injured reserve, but Mitch needed the metaphor.*

Sean, meanwhile, watched Justin Jefferson—JUSTIN JEFFERSON—score 3 points. Three. Points. That's less than what the Bluth family spent on breakfast.

*They spent $45 on breakfast. Each.*

Travis Etienne Jr. tried to salvage dignity with 19 points, and Devin Singletary added 16, but when your supposed WR1 scores what a kicker gets for a single field goal, you're not winning anything except sympathy.

*He didn't win that either.*

## "I Don't Understand the Question and I Won't Respond to It" - Dan's Defensive Stand

Dan (4-7) lost to Cal (6-5) by the slimmest of margins, 109.5 to 98, in what observers called "technically a football game."

*It barely qualified.*

Dan's roster featured Saquon Barkley scoring 6 points, a performance so disappointing it made Lindsay Bluth's business ventures look successful. Davante Adams managed 8 points, apparently having confused "elite receiver" with "decoy." 

*No one was fooled by the decoy either.*

Cal, celebrating his 109.5-point victory like he'd just won the lottery, was carried by Bijan Robinson's 25 points. The Steelers defense added 16, proving once again that in fantasy football, as in the Bluth family, sometimes the best offense is someone else's complete incompetence.

*This was often.*

"I played perfectly," Cal announced, despite barely crossing the 100-point threshold in a week where Chris scored 155.

*Narrator: He had not played perfectly.*

## "I've Got the Worst F***ing Attorneys" - Pete's Legal Victory

Pete (6-5) defeated Aaron 98-60 in what could generously be called a "matchup."

*It was more like a sentencing.*

Sean Tucker exploded for 33 points, the week's second-highest individual score, performing like a Bluth who'd actually read the plea deal before signing it. Travis Kelce, meanwhile, managed just 14 points, continuing his season-long impression of a formerly great athlete.

*He was still pretty good, just not fantasy-good.*

Brandon Aiyuk remained out, Sam LaPorta sat on injured reserve, and yet Pete still nearly scored 100 points. It was like succeeding despite having Tobias as your publicist.

*You wouldn't succeed. No one would.*

Aaron's 60 points, as mentioned, set a new standard for futility. Even his bright spot, Tetairoa McMillan's 25 points, felt hollow, like finding a $20 bill in the pocket of pants you're donating to charity.

*Aaron didn't donate to charity.*

## "There's a Good Chance I May Have Committed Some Light Treason" - Joe's Narrow Escape

Joe (9-2) defeated Mike (4-7) 91-65.5 in what Joe called "a tactical masterpiece."

*Narrator: It was not.*

Jacoby Brissett, somehow starting for Joe, put up 25 points, performing with all the unexpected competence of Barry Zuckerkorn winning a case. George Pickens added 17, and Justin Fields contributed 16, creating a quarterback situation more confusing than the Bluth family tree.

*That tree had some unexpected branches.*

Mike, meanwhile, watched his team score 65.5 points with the expression of someone who'd just realized the free attorney was actually Barry.

*Barry was not free. He was very expensive and very bad.*

Emari Demercado being out didn't help, though at this point, Mike's season had more injuries than George Sr.'s excuses for being in Mexico.

*He had many excuses. None were good.*

---

## "I May Have Committed Some Light Scoring" - Bruce vs. Matt's Defensive Struggle

In the week's final matchup, Matt (7-4) defeated Bruce (6-5) 94-67.5, though "defeated" suggests more action than what actually occurred.

*Very little occurred.*

Matt rode Bryce Young's surprising 32-point performance and Christian McCaffrey's 30 points to victory. C.J. Stroud sat out with a concussion, creating a quarterback situation that Matt handled better than the Bluths handled any situation.

*This is a very low bar.*

Bruce, meanwhile, lost Calvin Ridley to injured reserve and watched Nick Chubb score 0 points. Zero. The same number of times the Bluths' business ventures succeeded.

*Still zero.*

His 67.5 points represented the kind of performance that makes you question your life choices, like Tobias pursuing acting.

*He never stopped pursuing it. It never got better.*

## "On the Next Arrested Development..." - Week 12 Preview

*Narrator: On the next Arrested Development...*

The league heads into Week 12 with Chris and Joe tied at 9-2, though Chris holds the tiebreaker like George Sr. held onto those offshore accounts.

*Illegally and temporarily.*

Aaron, at 2-9, continues to field a roster held together by athletic tape and false hope. His three injured quarterbacks have formed a support group.

*They meet on Wednesdays. No one attends.*

The middle of the pack—Matt (7-4), Pete, Cal, and Bruce (all 6-5)—fight for playoff position with all the grace of the Bluth family at a charity auction.

*There was no grace. Someone usually got arrested.*

*Narrator: The league continued its march toward the playoffs, though "march" suggests more coordination than was actually displayed. It was more of a stumble, really. Like Lucille after wine club.*

*Wine club was every day.*

*Ron Howard: And that's why you always check your injury reports.*
