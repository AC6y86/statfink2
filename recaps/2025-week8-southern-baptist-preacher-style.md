# **WEEK 8 REVIVAL: THE GREAT FANTASY FOOTBALL AWAKENING OF 2025**
## *A Fire-and-Brimstone Sermon from the Church of the Gridiron*

---

**DEARLY BELOVED, WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY** in the holy sanctuary of fantasy football to witness MIRACLES and TRIBULATIONS! Can I get an AMEN? (*AMEN!*) I said, CAN I GET AN AMEN? (*AMEN!*) 

Brothers and sisters, Week 8 of our 2025 fantasy football season has come and gone like a thief in the night, stealing hopes and dreams from some while blessing others with ABUNDANT RICHES! The average score this week was 88.4 points, but OH MY CHILDREN, we saw the highest of highs and the LOWEST OF LOWS! We witnessed the RIGHTEOUS scoring 174.5 points while the WICKED barely scraped together 20! 

Turn with me now to the Book of Statistics, Chapter 8, where we shall read about REDEMPTION and DAMNATION, about those who WALKED IN THE LIGHT and those who STUMBLED IN DARKNESS! For the Lord said, "Blessed are those who start the right players, for they shall inherit the weekly victory!" HALLELUJAH!

## **THE ANOINTED ONE: Brother Joe's Glorious Ascension (174.5 Points)**

**SOMEBODY SHOUT GLORY!** (*GLORY!*) Brother Joe, OH BROTHER JOE, he done been TOUCHED BY THE HAND OF THE ALMIGHTY this week! One hundred and seventy-four point five heavenly points! Can you BELIEVE IT? (*We believe it, Pastor!*)

Let me TESTIFY about what I witnessed with my own two eyes! Brother Joe had Jonathan Taylor running like he was being chased by the hounds of heaven itself - THIRTY-SIX POINTS of pure, sanctified rushing! That man was POSSESSED by the spirit of Walter Payton! And James Cook III? Oh Lord, James Cook III cooked up THIRTY-ONE POINTS of that good gospel gravy! Somebody say HALLELUJAH! (*HALLELUJAH!*)

But that ain't all, church! No sir! Saquon Barkley added TWENTY-EIGHT MORE POINTS to the collection plate! Three running backs combining for NINETY-FIVE POINTS! That's not fantasy football, that's a REVIVAL! That's a TENT MEETING! That's speaking in TONGUES and handling SNAKES!

Brother Chris tried to keep up, bless his heart. He put up 150.5 points, which on any other Sunday would've had us shouting from the mountaintops! Tucker Kraft caught passes like he was catching the Holy Spirit - TWENTY-FIVE POINTS! RJ Harvey harvested TWENTY-FOUR POINTS like he was gathering souls for the Lord! Josh Allen threw for TWENTY-ONE POINTS worth of touchdown testaments! But when you're standing next to Moses parting the Red Sea, even walking on water looks ordinary! Brother Joe took this matchup 174.5 to 150.5, and there wasn't nothing Chris could do but say "THY WILL BE DONE!"

## **THE BATTLE OF THE BARELY BLESSED: Mitch vs. Matt (80.5 - 82.0)**

Now church, let me tell you about a matchup so close, so NERVE-WRACKING, that angels themselves were biting their fingernails! Brother Mitch and Brother Matt, they fought like Jacob wrestling with the angel, all night long, neither one willing to let go!

Brother Matt, OH BROTHER MATT, he had some soldiers fighting through adversity! Derrick Henry, that OLD TESTAMENT WARRIOR, he only managed nineteen points, but sometimes David only needs one stone! C.J. Stroud, bless his young heart, also contributed nineteen points of determination! But listen here, church, Brother Matt was playing with a CROWN OF THORNS on his head - A.J. Brown was OUT! Bryce Young was OUT! J.J. McCarthy was OUT! He had more injuries than Job had boils!

Brother Mitch, Lord have mercy, was in his own valley of the shadow of death! Brock Purdy - OUT! Cam Skattebo - OUT! Lamar Jackson - OUT! Michael Penix Jr. - OUT! Puka Nacua - OUT! This man's injury report looked like the casualties at Armageddon! His active roster was held together with PRAYERS and DUCT TAPE!

In the end, Brother Matt prevailed by just ONE AND A HALF POINTS! 82.0 to 80.5! That's closer than a cheap man's wallet, church! That's tighter than the gate to heaven! Sometimes the Lord's blessings come in SMALL PACKAGES! Can I get a witness? (*WE WITNESS!*)

## **THE VALLEY OF DRY BONES: Cal's Catastrophic Collapse (20.0 Points)**

OH MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS, we must now speak of TRAGEDY! We must speak of DEVASTATION! We must speak of Brother Cal's team, which scored... *[dramatic pause, voice drops to a whisper]* ...twenty points. TWENTY! POINTS!

Church, I've seen droughts in the desert, but THIS? This was BIBLICAL! Caleb Williams, his quarterback, managed only nine points - that's less than a TITHE! Isaiah Davis scraped together five points like he was picking up crumbs from the rich man's table! Tyler Warren and Kyle Pitts each contributed three measly points - together they couldn't buy a fish and a loaf!

But here's where it gets TRULY APOCALYPTIC, beloved! Bijan Robinson - ZERO POINTS! Tyrone Tracy Jr. - ZERO POINTS! Emeka Egbuka - ZERO! Keon Coleman - ZERO! Dylan Sampson - ZERO! Chris Rodriguez Jr. - ZERO! And Drake London was struck down with injury, OUT like Goliath after David's stone!

Brother Eli, playing against this team that was more cursed than the fig tree Jesus rejected, scored 57.5 points and probably felt like he was bullying children at Sunday school! Tua Tagovailoa threw for twenty-six points while Patrick Mahomes added twenty-four, and it was MORE than enough! This wasn't David versus Goliath - this was Goliath versus a newborn lamb! The final score: 57.5 to 20.0, and frankly, it wasn't even THAT close!

## **THE RIGHTEOUS DEMOLITION: Bruce's Holy Hammer vs. Pete's Purgatory (109.5 - 42.0)**

SOMEBODY SAY "MERCY!" (*MERCY!*) But there WAS no mercy in this matchup, church! Brother Bruce came down like the walls of Jericho on poor Brother Pete!

Brother Bruce had Drake Maye throwing for TWENTY-SEVEN POINTS like he was Moses throwing down the tablets! Bo Nix added TWENTY-SIX MORE POINTS of pure Denver dynamite! Daniel Jones - yes, DANIEL JONES - rose from the dead to contribute TWENTY-FOUR POINTS! Even Chase Brown ran for nineteen points like he was fleeing from Pharaoh's army! And he did all this despite Brock Bowers being OUT with injury!

Meanwhile, Brother Pete... OH, BROTHER PETE! *[shakes head sorrowfully]* This man had Brandon Aiyuk on injured reserve! Bucky Irving - OUT! Nico Collins - OUT! Ricky Pearsall - OUT! His roster looked like a MASH unit after D-Day! Forty-two points was all he could muster, and Brother Bruce showed him no mercy, crushing him 109.5 to 42.0! That's not a defeat, that's an EXORCISM!

---

## **THE TALE OF TWO JOURNEYMEN: Mike's Narrow Victory (88.0 - 64.5)**

Brothers and sisters, Brother Mike and Brother Dan fought the good fight, but only one could emerge VICTORIOUS!

Brother Mike had Jordan Love spreading TWENTY-NINE POINTS worth of Green Bay gospel! That was the difference maker, church! That was the CORNERSTONE that the builders didn't reject! Eighty-eight points total, right at the weekly average, but sometimes being average in the land of the struggling is being BLESSED!

Brother Dan, poor Brother Dan, he had Jalen Hurts trying his best with twenty-six points, but when Hassan Haskins is OUT and the rest of your roster is performing like they're in the wilderness for forty years, even Moses couldn't part those waters! Sixty-four and a half points, below the promised land of average, and Brother Mike took the victory 88.0 to 64.5!

---

## **THE BEATDOWN OF THE BEWILDERED: Sean's Smiting of Aaron (126.0 - 66.0)**

CAN THE CHURCH SAY "DOMINATION"? (*DOMINATION!*)

Brother Sean came with the FURY of the Old Testament God! Breece Hall rushed for THIRTY POINTS like he was Samson with the jawbone of a donkey! Justin Herbert threw for TWENTY-FOUR POINTS! Joe Flacco - JOE FLACCO, church! - added another TWENTY-FOUR POINTS! Even with Garrett Wilson OUT injured, Brother Sean put up ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SIX POINTS!

Brother Aaron, bless his struggling soul, was fighting with one hand tied behind his back! Jakobi Meyers - OUT! Jayden Daniels - OUT! Kyler Murray - OUT! His quarterback situation was more dire than Moses' when he was stuttering before Pharaoh! Jaxson Dart tried with nineteen points, but when you're facing a tsunami with a bucket, you're gonna get WET! Final score: 126.0 to 66.0, and Brother Aaron needs our PRAYERS!

## **THE BENEDICTION AND PROPHECY**

Church, as we close this service, let us remember that in fantasy football, as in LIFE, we will have MOUNTAINS and VALLEYS! We will have times of ABUNDANCE like Brother Joe's 174.5 points, and times of FAMINE like Brother Cal's 20 points!

Some of you are riding high like Brother Joe with his trio of running back ANGELS! Some of you are in the pit of despair like Brother Cal, wondering if the Lord has FORSAKEN you! But remember, church, it's not about how you fall - it's about how you RISE! Next week is a new opportunity for REDEMPTION!

To those in the basement - Brother Cal at 20 points, Brother Pete at 42 - your RESURRECTION Sunday is coming! To those at the top - Brother Joe, Brother Chris, Brother Sean - remember that PRIDE comes before the FALL!

The playoffs are approaching like the second coming, brothers and sisters! Every point matters! Every decision counts! Will you be among the CHOSEN who make the postseason PROMISED LAND? Or will you be cast into the outer darkness of the consolation bracket, where there is WEEPING and GNASHING OF TEETH?

Let us go forth into Week 9 with RENEWED SPIRIT! Let us set our lineups with WISDOM! Let us check our injury reports with DILIGENCE! And let us always remember - in fantasy football, as in faith, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!

CAN I GET ONE FINAL AMEN? (*AMEN!*)
I SAID, CAN I GET AN AMEN? (*AMEN!*)
SOMEBODY SHOUT HALLELUJAH! (*HALLELUJAH!*)

**Go forth and SET THOSE LINEUPS, children! The fantasy gods are watching!**

*Thus ends our Week 8 sermon. Collection plates will be passed for those who lost by more than 50 points. See Brother Cal after service for grief counseling. Coffee and sympathy in the Fellowship Hall.*

**PEACE BE WITH YOUR ROSTERS. AMEN!** 🙏🏈
