## *Direct from the Crystal Radio Network Studios*

*[Static crackles]... [Orchestral fanfare plays]*

**GOOD EVENING, SPORTS FANS!** This is your announcer, Chester "Chuck" Worthington III, coming to you LIVE from the mahogany-paneled studios of WFFL Radio, where the tubes are glowing warm and the dial is set to VICTORY! Tune in your radio sets, adjust those cat whiskers, and gather 'round the parlor, ladies and gentlemen, for I have a tale of gridiron glory and despair that will positively make your aerial antenna quiver with excitement!

It's Week Five of the grand Fantasy Football season of Twenty-Twenty-Five, and oh my stars and garters, what a week it has been! The autumn leaves are falling, the radiowaves are crackling with energy, and twelve team owners have just concluded battles that would make the Great War look like a Sunday picnic in Central Park! So pour yourself a spot of bathtub gin—er, I mean, a nice glass of sarsaparilla—and let this humble broadcaster regale you with tales from the fantasy gridiron!

Before we commence with the individual contests, allow me to paint you a picture of the league standings, dear listeners. Leading our distinguished fellowship with a commanding 598.5 net points is none other than Joe's Team—a squad that has been running roughshod over the competition like a Model T Ford with no brakes! Following in hot pursuit is Chris's Team with 570.0 points, playing the role of the plucky underdog who refuses to say die! Meanwhile, at the bottom of our standings—and I say this with all due respect to the gentleman—Aaron's Team sits with 404.5 points, looking rather like a fellow who brought a butter knife to a tommy gun fight!

## **THE MAIN EVENT: JOE'S MAGNIFICENT MASSACRE**

*[Dramatic organ music swells]*

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, what transpired between Joe's Team and Mitch's Team was not merely a football match—it was a public execution broadcast across the airwaves! **162.5 to 61.0!** Great Caesar's ghost! That's a 101.5-point shellacking that would make even Babe Ruth tip his cap in amazement!

Joe's squad performed like a well-oiled Victrola, playing sweet music while poor Mitch's boys stumbled around like they'd been hitting the giggle water a bit too hard before kickoff. Even with Jayden Reed languishing on the Injured Reserve list and young J.J. McCarthy unable to contribute, Joe's remaining seventeen players averaged nearly TEN points per man! That's the kind of efficiency that would make Henry Ford himself green with envy! It was as if Joe had discovered the secret formula for turning pigskin into pure gold, while Mitch was still trying to figure out which end of the football to hold!

The devastation was so complete, so thorough, that Western Union operators are refusing to send the final score via telegram, fearing it might cause heart palpitations among the receiving parties! Mitch's Team, already dwelling in the cellar at 432.5 total points for the season, has now experienced what we in the broadcast business call "a drubbing of historic proportions." With George Kittle on Injured Reserve, Mitch's squad looked about as threatening as a Charleston dancer with two left feet! This wasn't David versus Goliath—this was Goliath versus David's third cousin twice removed who forgot to bring his slingshot!

## **THE SECOND HEADLINE: MATT'S MARVELOUS COMEBACK**

*[Timpani roll]*

Hold onto your bowler hats, listeners, because Matt's Team has awakened from their slumber like a grizzly bear in springtime! **122.0 to 76.0** over Dan's Team—a 46-point triumph that has the wireless telegraph operators working overtime to spread the news!

Matt's boys, despite missing the services of Tyreek Hill (Injured Reserve with a bum wheel) and kicker Tyler Bass (also relegated to the injury list), orchestrated a performance worthy of a Ziegfeld Follies production! Every player seemed to be doing the Turkey Trot into the end zone! Meanwhile, Dan's Team, handicapped by the loss of Austin Ekeler to Injured Reserve, looked positively befuddled, like a fellow trying to tune in WGN while sitting in Poughkeepsie! 

This victory catapults Matt from the doldrums into respectability—though at 465.0 total points, he's still got more climbing to do than a window washer at the Woolworth Building! Dan, sitting at 471.5 points overall, must be wondering if he should trade in his crystal radio set for a Ouija board to divine better lineup decisions! The old sport fought valiantly, but when the final whistle blew via pneumatic tube to our studio, Matt stood triumphant, his team having delivered a performance that would make Al Jolson jealous!

## **THE NAIL-BITERS AND HEART-STOPPERS**

*[Xylophone glissando]*

But wait, there's more drama than a Mary Pickford picture show! Let me tell you about the absolute barn-burners that had listeners from coast to coast on the edge of their Morris chairs!

**Chris's Team versus Sean's Team (124.0 to 93.5):** Now here's a contest that started closer than two coats of paint! Chris, our second-place stalwart, managed to pull away from Sean like a rumrunner outpacing the revenue agents! With a 30.5-point victory, Chris keeps pace in the championship chase at 570.0 total points. Sean, meanwhile, despite the absence of Najee Harris on Injured Reserve, fought with the tenacity of a bare-knuckle boxer in the 15th round! But alas, at 447.0 total points for the season, Sean's squad is looking more like a vaudeville comedy act than a serious contender!

**Pete's Team edges Cal's Team (120.5 to 96.5):** Stop the presses! Pete's Team, despite missing THREE players to injury—Brandon Aiyuk (Out), Graham Gano (IR), and Joe Burrow (IR with a toe injury that sounds positively medieval)—managed to outscore Cal by 24 points! It's like winning a Charleston contest with your shoelaces tied together! Cal's Team, hampered by Braelon Allen and Malik Nabers both on Injured Reserve, couldn't muster enough mustard to catch Pete's hot dog! This victory keeps Pete in the middle of the pack at 480.0 points, while Cal drops to 551.5 but remains in third place overall!

## **THE CLOSE SHAVES AND WHISKER-THIN MARGINS**

*[Clarinet trill]*

**Aaron's Team squeaks past Mike's Team (108.0 to 102.0):** By the whiskers on President Coolidge's chin, what a squeaker! Aaron's Team, dwelling in the league's basement like a forgotten jar of preserves, managed to edge Mike by a mere 6 points! Mike, playing without the services of Mike Evans (Out), fought tooth and nail but came up shorter than a flapper's skirt! This puts Aaron at 404.5 total points—still dead last but showing signs of life—while Mike sits at 453.5, wondering if he should consult a fortune teller for next week's lineup decisions!

**Bruce's Team handles Eli's Team (107.0 to 84.0):** Bruce's squad delivered a 23-point thumping to poor Eli, whose team is more banged up than a Model T after a demolition derby! With Joe Mixon (Out), Omarion Hampton (Out), and Trey Benson (IR) all unavailable, Eli's team performed about as well as a one-legged tap dancer! Bruce climbs to 496.5 total points, sitting pretty in fourth place, while Eli languishes at 456.0, his playoff hopes fading faster than the signal from a distant radio station!

## **THE PERFORMANCE TIER ANALYSIS**

*[Brass section fanfare]*

Listeners, if we were to categorize our twelve team owners into performance tiers this week, it would look something like the floors of a swanky Manhattan hotel!

**The Penthouse Suite (120+ points):** Only two teams checked into this exclusive club—Joe's astronomical 162.5 and Matt's impressive 122.0! These gentlemen are sipping champagne while the rest are drinking soda pop!

**The Business Class (100-119 points):** We find Chris (124.0), Pete (120.5), Aaron (108.0), Bruce (107.0), and Mike (102.0) all performing respectably, like steady Eddie businessmen making their quotas!

**The Basement Dwellers (Under 100 points):** Oh, the humanity! Cal (96.5), Sean (93.5), Eli (84.0), Dan (76.0), and poor, poor Mitch (61.0) all scored fewer points than a Tin Pan Alley songwriter on a bad day! These teams need more help than a fellow trying to assemble a radio kit with no instructions!

The gap between Joe's 162.5 and Mitch's 61.0 represents a 101.5-point chasm wider than the Grand Canyon and twice as deep! It's the kind of disparity that makes you wonder if they're even playing the same sport!

## **THE BUST BRIGADE**

*[Sad trombone: wah-wah-wah-wahhh]*

Every week, dear listeners, we must acknowledge those supposed stars who performed more like shooting stars—bright for a moment, then gone! This week's Bust Brigade is led by the entire roster of Mitch's Team, who collectively scored fewer points than a Presbyterian church's wine budget! 

Dan's Team also makes our dishonor roll, managing only 76 points despite having most of his roster intact! It's as if his players decided to take a Sunday drive instead of playing football! And Eli's Team, while hampered by injuries, still disappointed those brave souls who tuned in expecting fireworks but got sparklers instead!

---

## **LOOKING AHEAD: THE ROAD TO THE PLAYOFFS**

*[Orchestral crescendo]*

As we peer into our crystal balls—er, I mean, analyze the statistical trends—several storylines emerge like smoke signals from a peace pipe! Joe's Team, with their commanding lead and explosive offense, looks unstoppable, like a locomotive with no brakes! But Chris's Team lurks in the shadows, waiting for their moment to strike!

The middle of the pack remains tighter than a flapper's corset, with positions three through eight separated by merely 75 points! One spectacular week or one disastrous showing could completely reshape the playoff picture! 

Meanwhile, at the bottom, Aaron's Team, Mitch's Team, and Sean's Team need to start stringing together victories faster than you can say "Twenty-three skidoo!" or their seasons will be over quicker than a speakeasy raid!
