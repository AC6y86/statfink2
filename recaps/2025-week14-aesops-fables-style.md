# The Fables of Week Fourteen
## A Collection of Moral Tales from the Fantasy Gridiron, Season 2025

*Gather round, dear children of the fantasy realm, for old Aesop has returned from his wanderings to share with you the tales of Week Fourteen - stories of triumph and folly, wisdom and foolishness, that echo through the ages as surely as the cries of managers watching their star players score naught but goose eggs.*

## The Lion and the Magnificent Feast

### A Tale of Chris the Dominant

In the great savanna of fantasy football, there lived a Lion named Chris, whose mane gleamed with the gold of 189.5 points - a score so magnificent that lesser beasts could only gaze upon it in wonder and despair.

The Lion had assembled a pride most fearsome. At the head of his hunting party stood Josh Allen the Swift, a Falcon-turned-Buffalo who soared through the skies with 40 points of pure, devastating majesty. When Allen spread his wings and took flight across the field, all other quarterbacks scattered like frightened mice. The Lion also possessed Tony Pollard the Tireless, a Gazelle who bounded through the undergrowth for 28 points, his hooves never tiring as he galloped toward the end zone.

But the Lion's wisdom ran deeper than mere stars. He had collected an entire pack of competent creatures: Sam Darnold contributed 21 points, Dak Prescott added 19, and a quartet of running backs - Josh Jacobs, De'Von Achane, and RJ Harvey - each provided 14 points of consistent production. Even his Kickers, Brandon Aubrey (10.5 points) and Cam Little (6 points), struck true with their field goals.

**The Moral:** *He who builds his army with both lions and capable hyenas shall feast upon the bounty of the land, while those who rely solely upon stars that have fallen dim shall know only hunger.*

## The Cunning Fox and the Overconfident Hare

### The Fable of Dan's Victory Over Joe

Once upon a time, in a matchup that the forest whispered about for weeks, a Fox named Dan faced a Hare named Joe, who had grown comfortable in his position atop the standings with his record of 10 wins and only 2 defeats.

The Hare Joe looked upon his roster and felt assured of victory. Had he not Christian Watson, who delivered 22 points? Did he not command Jacoby Brissett, whose 19 points seemed adequate? Surely his army of runners - Jonathan Taylor (11), Jordan Mason (11), Jaylen Warren (8), and James Cook (6) - would carry him across the finish line.

But Joe had grown complacent. His prized wide receivers - Ladd McConkey, George Pickens, and Christian Kirk - lay motionless in the meadow, each contributing precisely zero points. His Eagles defense slumbered. Even Cade Otton the Tight End produced nothing. The Hare had entered the race carrying far too many passengers who refused to run.

The Fox Dan, meanwhile, had prepared cunningly. Blake Corum the Ram charged forward with 25 points, breaking through defensive lines like they were morning mist. Aaron Rodgers the Aged Owl, wise in the ways of the passing game, contributed 22 points of aerial mastery. Marvin Mims Jr. darted about for 20 points, while the great Saquon Barkley - despite being somewhat contained - still added 17 to the cause.

When the dust settled, the Fox stood victorious at 124.5 points to the Hare's 100.5. The margin of 24 points told the story of preparation defeating presumption.

**The Moral:** *Swift legs mean nothing when half your runners refuse to leave the starting blocks. The fox who prepares shall defeat the hare who assumes.*

## The Peacock Who Lost His Feathers

### A Most Humiliating Fable of Mike's Disgrace Against Bruce

*Hearken well to this tale, for it speaks of a Peacock named Mike, whose beautiful plumage proved to be nothing but an illusion, and whose humiliation shall echo through the ages as a warning to all who mistake flash for substance.*

There once lived a Peacock named Mike who strutted about the barnyard, displaying feathers he believed were the finest in all the land. "Behold!" cried the Peacock. "I possess Jahmyr Gibbs, the swiftest creature in the realm!" And indeed, Gibbs performed magnificently, racing through the opposition for 30 glorious points. "See also Jordan Love," continued Mike, "my quarterback who shall lead me to victory with his 21 points!"

But pride, dear children, goes before a fall - and what a catastrophic, embarrassing, completely self-inflicted fall it was.

For you see, the Peacock Mike had filled the rest of his roster with broken wagons and sleeping donkeys. Chris Godwin the Wounded dragged himself across the field for a mere 3 points. Quinshon Judkins limped along for 3 more. The Bills Defense, which Mike had trusted, contributed only 8 points while his Packers Defense lay dormant at zero. His receivers - Romeo Doubs, Oronde Gadsden II - produced the same nothing as a scarecrow in an empty field.

Across the meadow stood a humble Badger named Bruce, who had assembled a modest but functioning team. Michael Wilson the Cardinal soared for 25 points. Chase Brown galloped for 16. Jerry Jeudy caught passes for 14, while Bo Nix quietly contributed 14 of his own. Even DK Metcalf (9) and Brock Bowers (8) added meaningful contributions.

The final score read Bruce 96.0, Mike 94.5 - a margin of just 1.5 points. But let no one mistake this for a close contest of equals. The Peacock Mike had Jahmyr Gibbs score 30 points - THIRTY POINTS - from a single running back, and still managed to lose. Gibbs alone outscored eight of Mike's other players combined.

The Badger Bruce, meanwhile, carried multiple players who contributed zero points - Ja'Marr Chase (0), Nick Chubb (0), and several others - yet still emerged victorious because his supporting cast actually showed up to work.

Let us speak plainly of Mike's disgrace: When your best player scores 30 points and you still lose by any margin whatsoever, you have failed in the most fundamental way possible. The Peacock had been given a golden goose that laid a 30-point egg, and he still could not carry it across the finish line. His roster management was so poor, his complementary pieces so utterly useless, that even historic individual performance could not save him from his own incompetence.

**The Moral:** *A single beautiful feather does not make a bird worth envying. The peacock who parades with Gibbs the Great yet surrounds him with sleeping mules deserves not sympathy but ridicule. Mike's loss shall be spoken of in hushed tones as the cautionary tale of the manager who could not win with excellence handed to him on a silver platter. Truly, to squander 30 points from a single player and still taste defeat is to achieve a special kind of failure that requires genuine effort to accomplish.*

## The Industrious Ant and the Steady Climb

### Matt the Collector's Tale

High atop a modest hill labored an Ant named Matt, who had spent the season quietly gathering points, one kernel at a time. This week, the Ant discovered a treasure trove.

Shedeur Sanders, a young Eagle learning to fly, blessed Matt with 35 points of passing brilliance. Rashid Shaheed contributed 23 points of receiving grace. Even J.J. McCarthy, still developing his craft, added 15 to the pile. The Ant's final haul: 118.5 points - good for third place in the week's scoring.

Though not engaged in direct combat this week, the Ant continued his steady ascent, his 8-4 record suggesting that patient accumulation may yet lead to playoff glory.

**The Moral:** *The ant who gathers steadily, week upon week, may find himself better prepared for winter than the grasshopper who scores in bursts but cannot sustain.*

## The Wandering Shepherd and His Scattered Flock

### Pete's Tale of the Leaderless Herd

A Shepherd named Pete possessed fine animals - Joe Burrow (29 points) and Matthew Stafford (24) among them - yet his flock seemed determined to scatter in every direction except forward.

His 114 points this week spoke of potential unfulfilled. Travis Kelce, once the prize of any herd, grazed uselessly at zero. Brandon Aiyuk remained injured on the sideline. Zach Ertz, freshly wounded with a torn ACL, would provide no more milk this season. Ray Davis contributed nothing.

**The Moral:** *A shepherd with two fine dogs but sheep who will not follow is no better off than a shepherd with no dogs at all.*

- Eli the Elk: 75.5 points

**The Basement Creatures (Below 75 points)**
- Sean the Sloth: 61.5 points
- Aaron the Aardvark: 35.0 points - scraping the bottom of the barrel

## The Tale of the Broken Wings

### A Catalogue of the Wounded

Many fine creatures could not take flight this week, their wings broken and spirits dampened:

**In Aaron's Hollow:** Kyler Murray the Phoenix remains on Injured Reserve, his foot perhaps never to heal for Arizona. Marvin Harrison Jr. was listed Out, his talents wasted.

**In Bruce's Burrow:** Daniel Jones has torn his Achilles and shall fly no more this season.

**In Cal's Clearing:** Drake London sat Out with an aching knee.

**In Eli's Enclave:** Joe Mixon nurses his wounded foot and ankle, his return uncertain.

**In Mitch's Meadow:** Cam Skattebo lies on Injured Reserve with his ankle. Michael Penix Jr. recovers from full ACL reconstruction.

**In Pete's Pasture:** Brandon Aiyuk's knee remains questionable. Zach Ertz has fallen with a torn ACL, his season finished.

**In Sean's Shelter:** Eddy Pineiro's hamstring keeps him sidelined.

**The Moral:** *Even the mightiest creatures may fall to injury. Wise is the manager who plans for such misfortune.*

## The Grand Moral of Week Fourteen

*And so, dear children, as old Aesop closes his book of tales, let these lessons echo in your hearts:*

*The mighty Josh Allen reminded us that true champions perform when called upon. The Fox Dan showed that cunning preparation defeats overconfidence. The Peacock Mike demonstrated - in the most embarrassing fashion possible - that a single brilliant player cannot carry a roster of sleeping beasts.*

*But above all, remember this: In fantasy football, as in life, it is not the creature with the finest single feather who wins, but the creature whose entire flock moves as one toward the goal.*

*Go forth, dear managers, and may your rosters be filled not with peacocks' vanity, but with the steady industry of the ant and the cunning of the fox.*

---

*Thus concludes the Fables of Week Fourteen, in the Year of Our Fantasy 2025.*
