# WEEK 5: ANNIHILATION
## A StatFink2 Production

*[FADE IN: Black screen. Deep, rumbling bass note]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** *(gravelly, dramatic voice)*
In a world... where grown men stake their pride on the performance of millionaire athletes they've never met...

*[Thunder crack. Lightning illuminates a war-torn fantasy football field]*

Where friendships crumble... and egos shatter... every Sunday...

*[Dramatic orchestral swell]*

**THIS FALL...**

*[Quick cuts of scoreboards flashing]*

One week would change EVERYTHING.

## ACT I: THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM

*[Sweeping aerial shot of twelve fantasy teams lined up for battle]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
Week 5. October 2025. 

The league stood divided. Joe's Team commanded the heights with a 3-1 record, Chris's Team matching their pace stride for stride. But on this fateful Sunday... 

*[Record scratch. Freeze frame on Mitch's Team]*

...one man would discover what true devastation looks like.

*[Explosion sound effect]*

---

## ACT II: THE MASSACRE

### **"THE 91.5 POINT APOCALYPSE"**

*[Slow-motion shot of Joe's lineup card being revealed]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** *(building intensity)*
Joe came not to play... but to DESTROY.

Jonathan Taylor... TWENTY-NINE POINTS! *[Explosion]*
Justin Fields... TWENTY-THREE POINTS! *[Thunder]*
Rico Dowdle... TWENTY-THREE POINTS! *[Lightning]*
Mac Jones... TWENTY-TWO POINTS! *[Building collapse sound]*

One hundred and fifty points of pure, unbridled ANNIHILATION!

*[Cut to Mitch's scoreboard showing 58.5]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** *(somber)*
Mitch's Team... fifty-eight and a half points. The largest defeat in recent memory. A ninety-one point five beatdown that would echo through eternity.

*[Dramatic pause. Single violin note]*

Some say you could hear Mitch's soul leaving his body that Sunday afternoon. His roster, decimated by the cruel hand of fate—George Kittle languishing on Injured Reserve, his dreams as broken as his lineup.

**MITCH:** *(echoing whisper)*
"I... I thought I had a chance..."

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
He didn't.

---

### **"THE PRODIGAL SON RISES"**

*[Heroic music swells]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
But from the ashes of one man's destruction... another would rise!

MATT'S TEAM! After weeks of struggle, they unleashed their fury upon Dan's unsuspecting roster!

*[Rapid montage of scores]*

C.J. Stroud... TWENTY-SIX POINTS of quarterbacking excellence!
One hundred and twenty-two points to Dan's seventy-six!

**DAN:** *(desperate scream)*
"But I had Kyren Williams! He scored twenty-two!"

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
It wasn't enough. It would NEVER be enough. Not on this day. Matt improved to 4-1, while Dan fell to 3-2, left to wonder... what might have been.

*[Thunder rumbles ominously]*

---

## ACT III: THE BATTLES WITHIN BATTLES

### **"WHEN TITANS CLASH"**

*[Epic battle music]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
Across the battlefield, warriors engaged in combat so fierce, so brutal, that the fantasy gods themselves turned away!

*[Quick cuts between matchups]*

**THE BRUCE RESURGENCE!**
Bruce's Team, powered by Ja'Marr Chase's TWENTY-FIVE POINT explosion, defeated Eli 98.0 to 79.5! Despite Patrick Mahomes' valiant twenty-five point effort, despite Tua Tagovailoa's twenty-four point contribution, Eli's Team fell before Bruce's onslaught!

**THE MIKE AWAKENING!**
Mike's Team—trapped at 1-4—found redemption! Baker Mayfield and Jacory Croskey-Merritt combining for FORTY-NINE POINTS of destruction! Aaron's Team, despite Javonte Williams' twenty-five point heroics, fell 100.0 to 89.5!

**AARON:** *(anguished cry)*
"FIVE AND OH? More like OH AND FIVE!"

*[Sound of shattering glass]*

---

### **"THE RAZOR'S EDGE"**

*[Tense, suspenseful music]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** *(whispering intensely)*
But the closest battles... those are where legends are born.

Chris versus Sean. Ninety-eight to ninety-one. SEVEN POINTS separating victory from defeat!

*[Heartbeat sound effect getting faster]*

Sam Darnold's THIRTY-TWO POINTS! Josh Allen's twenty-two! Dak Prescott's twenty-six! Chris's arsenal firing on all cylinders!

Sean fought valiantly... but with Najee Harris trapped on Injured Reserve, his roster bled out on the field of battle. The final seven-point margin might as well have been seventy.

*[Single dramatic drum beat]*

And in the week's CLOSEST confrontation...

*[Music stops. Complete silence]*

Cal's Team. Ninety-four points.
Pete's Team. Ninety-six and a half.

**TWO. POINT. FIVE. POINTS.**

*[Explosion of sound]*

Trevor Lawrence's THIRTY POINTS for Cal! But Matthew Stafford's twenty-seven, Jared Goff's twenty-four, and Jake Browning's twenty-four—Pete's quarterback triumvirate—proved just enough! By the slimmest of margins, Pete survived, while Cal was left to wonder about every lineup decision, every point left on the bench.

**CAL:** *(broken whisper)*
"Two and a half points... I lost by two and a half points..."

---

## ACT IV: THE HIERARCHY OF POWER

## EPILOGUE: THE ROAD AHEAD

*[Epic, forward-looking music]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
Week 5 has passed. The damage is done. The scars are permanent.

Joe stands atop the mountain, his 150-point explosion still echoing across the league. Mitch lies broken at the bottom of the canyon, wondering if he'll ever recover from a 91.5-point defeat.

Matt has risen. Aaron has fallen. Chris maintains his iron grip on excellence while Mike glimpses redemption.

*[Music builds to final crescendo]*

But this war... is far from over.

Eight weeks remain. Eight weeks of glory. Eight weeks of pain. Eight weeks where ANYTHING can happen.

*[Final dramatic pause]*

**THE QUESTION ISN'T WHO WILL WIN...**

**IT'S WHO WILL SURVIVE.**

*[Screen goes black]*

**WEEK 6**
**COMING SOON**

*[Final thunder crack]*
