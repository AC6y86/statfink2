## ACT I: THE PROLOGUE
### Scene I. A Digital Battlefield, Where Fantasy Becomes Reality

**CHORUS:**
*In iambic pentameter*

Attend, good gentles all, to tales of woe,
Where fantasy and football's fates do flow!
In Week the Fifth, our noble lords did fight,
Some bathed in glory's gold, some lost to night.
The standings shake like autumn's dying leaves,
While Joseph rules o'er all who dare believe.

Forsooth! This week did bring both joy and pain,
As scores both high and low did fall like rain.
One lord scored one-five-oh in glorious might,
While poor Mitchell's fifty-eight brought naught but blight.
Come hither, witness how these battles rage,
Upon this gridiron's most dramatic stage!

---

## ACT II: THE MASSACRE OF HOUSE MITCHELL
### Scene I. The Throne Room of Lord Joseph

**LORD JOSEPH** *(soliloquy)*:

What light through yonder stat sheet breaks? 'Tis I,
Who scored one hundred fifty points so high!
Mine Jonathan Taylor, noble steed of backs,
Did rush for nine-and-twenty points' attacks!

Three quarterbacks I fielded in this fray—
Young Justin Fields with three-and-twenty's pay,
Mac Jones as well with two-and-twenty scored,
And Rico Dowdle joined my rushing horde!

But soft! What sorrow creeps across the field?
Poor Mitchell's team hath been completely peeled!
Just eight-and-fifty points his roster made—
The lowest score in all our fantasy trade!

**Enter GHOST OF MITCHELL'S HOPES**

**GHOST:**
Remember me! I was thy competition!
But Brian Robinson brought zero's mission!
Mine George Kittle lies wounded, out of play,
And Samaje Perine scoreth not this day!

**LORD JOSEPH:**
Begone, foul specter of defeated dreams!
Thy 91.5-point loss, methinks it seems,
Shall echo through the annals of our league—
A cautionary tale of fantasy fatigue!

*(Exit GHOST, wailing)*

## ACT III: THE UNEXPECTED TRIUMPH
### Scene I. The Court of Sir Matthew

**SIR MATTHEW** *(addressing his troops)*:

Hark! Though we stand but seventh in the realm,
This week we seized victory's golden helm!
Mine C.J. Stroud did throw for six-and-twenty,
While Christian McCaffrey gave us plenty!

Against Lord Daniel's six-and-seventy score,
We posted two-and-twenty points yet more!
One hundred twenty-two we did achieve—
A triumph that makes doubters now believe!

**LORD DANIEL** *(aside)*:

Alack! Mine Kyren Williams scored so well,
With two-and-twenty points he did excel!
And Jalen Hurts brought nineteen to the fight,
Yet still we fell to Matthew's greater might!

'Twas not enough! Our season's hope grows dim,
At six-place tied, our playoff chances slim.
Four hundred seventy-one point five we hold,
But glory's touch grows ever more ice-cold!

---

## ACT IV: THE DUEL OF INCHES
### Scene I. The Battleground Between Calvin and Peter

**PRINCE CALVIN:**
Mine Trevor Lawrence threw for thirty fair!
Emeka Egbuka caught passes through the air!
With two-and-twenty points he did provide,
And Jaxon Smith-Njigba by his side!

**DUKE PETER:**
But soft! Mine Matthew Stafford answered true,
With seven-and-twenty points he did accrue!
Both Jared Goff and Jake Browning scored their share,
Each bringing four-and-twenty through the air!

**CHORUS:**
By margins thin as parchment's edge they fought,
Just two point five between them when 'twas wrought!
Duke Peter claimed the victory most narrow,
His 96.5 shot true as arrow!

Yet Calvin's 94 was nobly won,
Though Brandon Aiyuk injured could not run,
And Graham Gano too lay wounded sore,
These absences did hurt his final score!

---

## ACT V: THE MIDDLE KINGDOM CLASHES
### Scene I. The Arena of Moderate Scores

**Enter MARQUIS MICHAEL and EARL AARON**

**MARQUIS MICHAEL:**
Mine hundred points exact did shine today!
Jacory Croskey-Merritt led the way,
With five-and-twenty points he did produce,
While Baker Mayfield's four-and-twenty loose!

Though Mike Evans lay wounded, could not play,
And Alvin Kamara scoreth naught this day,
We still prevailed by ten point five precise,
O'er Aaron's team—victory has its price!

**EARL AARON:**
Javonte Williams rushed for twenty-five!
And Jaxson Dart kept our hopes alive!
With nineteen points from our young quarterback,
We fought with honor, though success we lack!

Nine-and-eighty points and half we made,
But Michael's century could not be swayed!
We sink toward bottom of the league's great tower,
Four hundred four point five—our darkest hour!

---

## ACT VI: THE STEADY VETERANS
### Scene I. The Hall of Christopher and Sean

**SIR CHRISTOPHER:**
Sam Darnold! Oh, what quarterback art thou!
Two-and-thirty points upon thy brow!
And Dak Prescott with six-and-twenty more,
Josh Allen too with two-and-twenty's score!

Though some did fail—TreVeyon Henderson,
RJ Harvey, Jameson Williams' suspension
From scoring any points did hurt our cause—
We still secured the win despite these flaws!

**EARL SEAN:**
Mine Jaylen Waddle caught for seventeen,
The finest receiver that I've seen!
Yet ninety-one was all that we could muster,
Against Chris's eight-and-ninety's luster!

Seven points separated our two fates,
As Christopher ascends while Sean awaits
Some future glory in the weeks to come—
Four forty-seven total leaves me glum!

---

## ACT VII: THE RESURRECTION OF BRUCE
### Scene I. The Phoenix Chamber

**BARON BRUCE** *(triumphant)*:

From ashes of past weeks, I rise again!
Ja'Marr Chase led with five-and-twenty's gain!
Eight-and-ninety points secured the day,
Against Elijah's nine-and-seventy's play!

**COUNT ELIJAH** *(lamenting)*:

Alack! Three backs upon the injury list!
Joe Mixon, Hampton, Benson—all are missed!
Though Patrick Mahomes threw for twenty-five,
And Tua for four-and-twenty did strive,

'Twas not enough! Our wounded roster bleeds,
With Trey McBride and Palmer scoring seeds
Of zero points! T.J. Hockenson too!
Oh, cursed fate! What more could I construe?

Tyler Bass upon IR doth rest,
Our kicking game is sorely, sorely pressed!
Four fifty-six in total points we hold,
Our playoff dreams grow ever thin and cold!

## EPILOGUE: THE CHORUS SPEAKS
### Scene I. The Digital Realm at Twilight

**CHORUS:**

Thus ends Week Five's most tragic, comic tale,
Where Joseph's might did make poor Mitchell pale!
One fifty 'gainst just fifty-eight point five—
The greatest rout while our league is alive!

The standings shift like sand beneath our feet:
Joe leads with five nine eight point five complete,
While Christopher pursues with five and seventy,
And Calvin third with five five one in plenty!

At bottom dwells poor Aaron's struggling crew,
With four oh four point five they muddle through.
And Mitchell, though this week was full of woe,
Still tops poor Aaron's season-long tableau!

**Performance Tiers, as ordained by Fate:**

**The Elite** *(scoring above 120)*:
- Lord Joseph's magnificent 150
- Sir Matthew's surprising 122

**The Competitive** *(scoring 90-120)*:
- Marquis Michael's even 100
- Baron Bruce and Sir Christopher at 98
- Duke Peter's narrow 96.5
- Prince Calvin's solid 94
- Earl Sean's respectable 91

**The Struggling** *(scoring 70-90)*:
- Count Elijah's wounded 79.5
- Lord Daniel's disappointed 76
- Squire Aaron's faltering 89.5

**The Basement Dweller** *(below 70)*:
- Viscount Mitchell's catastrophic 58.5

## THE FINAL SOLILOQUY

**THE BARD OF FANTASY** *(addressing the audience)*:

What lessons learned from this week's bloody fight?
That fantasy, like life, brings joy and blight!
Lord Joseph stands atop our kingdom's peak,
While Mitchell's hopes grow ever more oblique!

The middle kingdom battles fierce and true—
Where Bruce and Peter, Michael, Calvin too,
Do wage their wars with margins razor-thin,
Each week uncertain who shall lose or win!

Poor Aaron languishes in basement's keep,
While Eli's wounded roster makes him weep!
Yet hope springs eternal in this game,
Next week brings chance for glory or for shame!

So raise thy goblets high, ye fantasy lords!
Toast victories won with algorithms' swords!
For Week the Sixth approaches with its test—
May fortune smile upon thy lineup's quest!

**FINIS**

---

*Exeunt all, pursued by a bear market in running backs*

*Thus concludes the Fifth Week's tale of woe and wonder,*
*Where Joseph's might tore Mitchell's hopes asunder!*
*Until next week, when battle's joined once more,*
*Upon the fantasy football's sacred shore!*

**[Curtain Falls]**
