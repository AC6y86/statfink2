# The Turkey Curse: Week 12 Recap
## Season 2025 - Thanksgiving Week Edition

---

*The ancient texts speak of it in hushed tones. Old league managers share the tale around crackling fire pits during bye weeks. It began, as all great curses do, in the gluttony of Week 1, when one owner consumed their fantasy points like they were so much dry turkey breast without gravy. That owner was Eli, and his 63.0-point performance in Week 1 awakened something dark, something hungry, something that would stalk this league for the entire season.*

*This is the story of The Turkey Curse.*

## The Curse's Bloody Trail: A Historical Accounting

Before we examine the carnage of Week 12, let us trace the dark path of The Turkey Curse through our season. The curse, you see, does not simply punish the lowest scorer. It MARKS them. And then, in cruel and capricious fashion, it leaps to whoever has the misfortune to face them next, or to whoever dares score lowest in a given week.

**Week 1:** Eli's Team awakens the curse with a dismal 63.0 points  
**Week 2:** Sean's Team becomes cursed (77.0) - they played Matt, who had been touched by Eli's energy  
**Week 3:** Aaron's Team falls hard (54.5) - the curse spreads through the standings  
**Week 4:** Aaron's Team again (77.0) - THE CURSE DOUBLES DOWN  
**Week 5:** Mitch's Team collapses (58.5) - played Joe who had defeated Aaron earlier  
**Week 6:** Mike's Team hits rock bottom (50.0) - the curse's most vicious strike yet  
**Week 7:** Mitch's Team returns to the abyss (59.5) - the curse remembers him  
**Week 8:** Cal's Team posts an unholy 20.0 points - the lowest of the season  
**Week 9:** Eli's Team (63.5) - the curse returns to its origin  
**Week 10:** Matt's Team (49.5) - Eli transferred it through their matchup  
**Week 11:** Aaron's Team again (60.0) - third time this season!  
**Week 12:** Mitch's Team (53.0) - also cursed for the third time

The statistical evidence is DAMNING. Aaron has been cursed THREE TIMES. Mitch has been cursed THREE TIMES. Eli started it all and has been cursed TWICE. These are not coincidences, friends. This is supernatural mathematics.

## The Turkey Day Massacre: Week 12 In Full

### The Week's Lowest Scorer: Mitch's Team (53.0 Points) - THE CURSE CARRIER

Oh, Mitch. Sweet, doomed Mitch. Just when you thought the curse had moved on, just when Week 11 had seemed to deposit its darkness upon Aaron's doorstep with that 60.0-point travesty, the ancient evil circled back like a vulture to carrion.

Fifty-three points. FIFTY-THREE POINTS during Thanksgiving week. The Turkey Curse quite literally devoured Mitch's roster from the inside out. Lamar Jackson, his supposed franchise quarterback, posted a big fat goose egg. Chuba Hubbard? Zero. Brian Robinson Jr.? Zero. Cooper Kupp, Stefon Diggs, Xavier Legette? ZERO, ZERO, ZERO. Six players scoring nothing. Half a roster turned to ash and bone.

The only players who bothered to show up were Kareem Hunt (17.0 points) gnawing on the scraps of the Kansas City backfield, Brock Purdy (11.0) doing his best impression of a game manager, and the kicking tandem of Tyler Loop and Jake Bates combining for 13.0 points. George Kittle (6.0) and Puka Nacua (6.0) offered crumbs, nothing more.

Chris's Team took the victory 79.5 to 53.0, but this was not a battle. This was a mercy killing. Chris rode Dak Prescott's 30.0-point explosion and Sam Darnold's 16.0-point backup contribution to an easy win, though his own squad had issues with Tony Pollard, Jameson Williams, and Jordan Addison all posting zeroes.

**The curse now resides with Mitch. And in Week 13, Chris faces Mitch again. The same matchup. The curse DEMANDS a rematch.**

### The Headliner: Joe's Team Erupts for 138.0 Points

While the curse devoured some, others feasted like kings at the Thanksgiving table. Joe's Team posted the week's highest score at 138.0 points, absolutely annihilating Aaron's Team who limped in with 64.5.

Jalen Hurts reminded everyone why he was a first-round pick, posting 30.0 fantasy points with his dual-threat devastation. But Joe's depth was the real story. Wan'Dale Robinson exploded for 20.0 points - a waiver wire gem paying dividends. James Cook added 17.0 points, George Pickens contributed 17.0, and even backup QB Jacoby Brissett chipped in 14.0 points off the bench.

Aaron's Team, meanwhile, suffered through another curse-adjacent week. Three separate players with goose eggs: Tank Bigsby, Mark Andrews, and Will Shipley. The Cowboys defense posted nothing. When your best player is Jakobi Meyers with 11.0 points, you are living in the shadow of the Turkey Curse whether you carry it or not.

Joe improves to 10-2 on the season, tied with Chris for the league lead. The path to the championship runs through these two juggernauts. Aaron falls to a league-worst 2-10, his season a wasteland of cursed weeks and broken dreams.

### Cal Carves Up Bruce: 124.5 to 63.0

Cal's Team delivered a Thanksgiving beatdown of its own, posting 124.5 points against Bruce's woeful 63.0. This was a clinic in how to build a roster, as Cal's depth pieces all contributed meaningful scores.

Jaxon Smith-Njigba was the star of the show, hauling in 28.0 fantasy points in what might be his breakout game of the season. Trevor Lawrence added 24.0 points, proving that Jacksonville quarterbacks can occasionally be competent. Caleb Williams contributed 21.0 points despite the Bears being the Bears. Rookie sensation Ashton Jeanty rumbled for 14.0, while fellow rookie Dylan Sampson added 11.0 from the backfield.

Bruce's Team, by contrast, looked like leftovers nobody wanted. Daniel Jones led the team with 16.0 points - and when Daniel Jones is your best player, you know the Turkey Curse is circling nearby. Drake Maye (14.0) and Chase Brown (9.0) provided some value, but eight players posted goose eggs including Nick Chubb, Jerry Jeudy, and both of Bruce's defense/special teams units.

Cal improves to 7-5 and stays firmly in the playoff hunt. Bruce drops to 6-6, teetering on the playoff bubble where the curse loves to feast.

### The Battle of Despair: Dan Barely Edges Pete, 60.5 to 54.0

Friends, this matchup was not football. This was two teams stumbling through a dark forest, blindly swinging at each other with wet noodles, hoping to not be the one who tripped into the curse's waiting maw.

Dan's Team managed 60.5 points. Pete's Team managed 54.0. The combined total of 114.5 points is barely above what Joe scored ALONE. Both teams should light a candle in thanks that one of them doesn't carry the weekly curse - that dishonor went to Mitch, who somehow scored even less.

Davante Adams was Dan's savior with 19.0 points, the only player on either roster to crack the 15-point threshold. Geno Smith added 14.0 in a world where that passes for serviceable. Saquon Barkley, the supposed fantasy superstar, managed a pathetic 3.0 points. Kyren Williams and Blake Corum both posted zeroes as the Rams' backfield situation continued to be an absolute disaster.

Pete's team was carried entirely by his quarterbacks: Matthew Stafford (24.0) and Jared Goff (19.0) combined for 43.0 of his 54.0 total points. SEVENTY-NINE PERCENT of his scoring came from two quarterbacks. D'Andre Swift? Zero. Travis Kelce? Zero. Nico Collins, returning from injury? A measly 3.0 points.

Dan improves to 5-7. Pete falls to 6-6. Neither team should feel good about themselves. The Turkey Curse watched this matchup with great interest, taking notes for future devastation.

### Matt's Revival: 101.5 to 71.0 Over Eli

After being cursed in Week 10 with that horrific 49.5-point performance, Matt's Team showed signs of breaking free from the dark magic. His 101.5-point effort against Eli represented his best output since Week 5's 122.0-point explosion.

The recipe was simple: get production from your stars. Derrick Henry rumbled for 19.0 points. DJ Moore caught everything for 19.0 points. Christian McCaffrey, finally healthy(ish), contributed 17.0 points. A.J. Brown added 17.0 as well. When your top four players all hit double digits, good things happen.

Eli's Team, the original curse-bearer from Week 1, posted 71.0 points in defeat. Amon-Ra St. Brown led with 17.0 points, Patrick Mahomes added 14.0, and Darnell Mooney chipped in 11.0. But David Montgomery, T.J. Hockenson, and Joshua Palmer all posted zeroes, the spectral fingerprints of the Turkey Curse still visible on Eli's roster.

Matt improves to 8-4, securing his spot as a legitimate playoff contender. Eli falls to 5-7, his original sin still haunting his season.

---

### Mike's Gibbs-Fueled Victory: 98.5 to 67.0 Over Sean

Jahmyr Gibbs is a MONSTER. The Detroit Lions running back posted an OBSCENE 39.0 fantasy points in Week 12, carrying Mike's Team to victory almost single-handedly. That 39.0-point performance represented nearly 40% of Mike's entire team output.

Beyond Gibbs, Mike got useful contributions from Quinshon Judkins (16.0), Harrison Butker (10.0), and the Packers defense (10.0). But six players posted goose eggs including Tee Higgins (out with concussion), Alvin Kamara, Jordan Love, and Tyjae Spears. Without Gibbs, Mike might be the one carrying the curse this week.

Sean's Team continues to struggle at 3-9, his season a wreck. Cam Ward's 22.0 points and Travis Etienne's 14.0 weren't enough to matter. Justin Jefferson, Sean's supposed alpha receiver, posted a zero. Rhamondre Stevenson? Zero. Devin Singletary? Zero. The 49ers and Jets defenses? Combined zero.

Mike improves to 5-7, still in the playoff mix. Sean's season is functionally over, but perhaps that's a blessing - the further from contention you fall, the less the Turkey Curse seems to care about you.

## Performance Tiers: Where The Curse Lurks

**THE ELITE (100+ points):** Only Joe (138.0), Cal (124.5), and Matt (101.5) cracked the century mark this week. These teams feast while others starve. The average between them was 121.3 points.

**THE MEDIOCRE MIDDLE (60-100 points):** Mike (98.5), Chris (79.5), and Eli (71.0). Surviving, not thriving. Living in fear of the curse but not yet consumed by it.

**THE BASEMENT DWELLERS (<60 points):** Sean (67.0), Aaron (64.5), Bruce (63.0), Dan (60.5), Pete (54.0), and THE CURSED ONE Mitch (53.0). Six teams below 70 points is a bloodbath. The Turkey Curse has spread its influence wide this week.

The league average this week was approximately 81.0 points. Five teams fell below average. The gap between Joe's 138.0 and Mitch's 53.0 is 85 points - you could fit an entire average team's score in that chasm.

## The Bust Brigade: Stars Who Disappointed

**Lamar Jackson (Mitch's Team):** 0.0 points. The former MVP, the dual-threat destroyer, posted a ZERO. The curse's fingerprints are all over this.

**Saquon Barkley (Dan's Team):** 3.0 points. The rushing leader's worst game of the season at the worst possible time.

**Travis Kelce (Pete's Team):** 0.0 points. The greatest tight end of his generation catching nothing but air.

**Justin Jefferson (Sean's Team):** 0.0 points. Triple coverage? Sure. But ZERO points? The curse spreads.

**Alvin Kamara (Mike's Team):** 0.0 points. Another superstar swallowed by the darkness.

## Week 13 Preview: The Curse's Next Victim?

The ancient texts are clear: **the curse jumps to whoever plays the cursed one next.** Mitch carries the curse into Week 13. And Mitch plays Chris.

Chris, the co-league-leader at 10-2. Chris, the man who just beat Mitch. Chris, who seems untouchable at the top of the standings. But the Turkey Curse does not care about records. It does not respect dominance. It HUNGERS.

Will Chris become the curse's first victim among the elite? Or will his roster's depth protect him from the dark magic? The prophecy is unclear, but one thing is certain: someone will score the lowest in Week 13, and the curse will claim another victim.

*The Turkey Curse is patient. The Turkey Curse is eternal. The Turkey Curse is coming for you.*
