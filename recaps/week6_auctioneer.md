## **THE BIDDING WARS: SIX MATCHUPS, SIX STORIES**

### **LOT NUMBER ONE: CHRIS'S COMMANDING VICTORY**

Do I hear one-twenty do I hear one-twenty-two ONE-TWENTY-TWO-POINT-FIVE to Chris's team absolutely DEMOLISHING Matt's squad with a fifty-five-point-five differential that's RIGHT fifty-five-point-five points of pure DOMINATION! Chris came to play came to WIN came to COLLECT with Dak Prescott throwing for TWENTY-FOUR Josh Jacobs running for TWENTY-FIVE De'Von Achane ALSO scoring TWENTY-FIVE that's a TRIPLE THREAT folks a bonafide TRIPLE THREAT!

Now poor Matt poor poor Matt sitting there with sixty-seven points watching Chris run away with the auction like he's got a unlimited credit line at the fantasy bank! Matt's got Bryce Young trying trying TRYING with twenty-one points but when you're outbid by FIFTY-FIVE-POINT-FIVE that's like bringing a butter knife to a sword fight bringing a tricycle to the Indy 500 bringing your grandmother's checkbook to compete with Warren Buffett! Chris moves to FIVE AND ONE folks that's ELITE STATUS that's PENTHOUSE SUITE that's FIRST CLASS ALL THE WAY with six-hundred-ninety-two-point-five total points good for SECOND PLACE overall!

Matt's sitting at four and two which sounds respectable sounds DECENT but with only five-hundred-thirty-two total points he's in the middle of the pack the DANGEROUS MIDDLE where one bad week sends you tumbling down faster than a house of cards in a hurricane! This loss this BRUTAL fifty-five-point loss that's the kind of setback that has you questioning your whole bidding strategy wondering if maybe just MAYBE you should have raised your paddle a little higher during the draft!

### **LOT NUMBER TWO: THE NAIL-BITER NOBODY WON**

Fifty-two-point-five to fifty-seven going once going twice going to MITCH by four-point-five points in the CLOSEST matchup of the week folks the absolute TIGHTEST margin you'll see in this auction house! Dan and Mitch going paddle to paddle bid for bid in a battle so close you needed a MAGNIFYING GLASS to see the difference!

Dan's got Jalen Hurts putting up TWENTY-TWO solid points SOLID but not spectacular while Mitch counters with Cam Skattebo the SURPRISE package delivering THIRTY POINTS who saw THAT coming nobody that's who NOBODY had Skattebo valued that high but that's the BEAUTY of the auction house sometimes the sleeper lots turn into TREASURES! But here's the tragedy folks the ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY Mitch had THREE running backs scoring ZERO that's right ZERO ZILCH NADA Brian Robinson Jr Kareem Hunt Samaje Perine all coming up EMPTY like a vault after a heist!

Both teams sitting at three and three after this barn burner both teams in that MURKY MIDDLE of the standings where anything can happen where dreams can still come true or nightmares can BEGIN! Dan with five-twenty-four total points Mitch with four-eighty-nine-point-five they're both one hot streak away from glory or one cold streak away from the BASEMENT!

### **LOT NUMBER THREE: JOE'S SIGNATURE ACQUISITION**

One-thirty-six-point-five going going GONE to Joe's team taking down Pete eighty-nine to one-thirty-six-point-five that's a FORTY-SEVEN-POINT-FIVE thrashing folks an absolute STATEMENT WIN from the league's OVERALL LEADER! Joe sitting pretty at FIVE AND ONE with SEVEN-THIRTY-FIVE total points that's FIRST PLACE that's the PENTHOUSE that's the CROWN JEWEL of our auction house!

Rico Dowdle coming through with TWENTY-THREE George Pickens adding TWENTY but wait there's a PLOT TWIST folks Justin Fields scoring ZERO that's right the backup quarterback gamble NOT paying off but when you're scoring one-thirty-six-point-five who CARES who's counting nobody that's who! Joe's team is like a well-oiled auction machine every piece working together even when one breaks down the whole thing keeps HUMMING keeps CHURNING keeps producing POINTS!

Poor Pete poor unfortunate Pete with only eighty-nine points watching Joe run away with it like a thief in the night! D'Andre Swift managed TWENTY but when that's your ONLY bright spot when that's your SOLE twenty-pointer you're not winning auctions you're not even PARTICIPATING you're just watching from the sidelines! Pete drops to TWO AND FOUR with five-sixty-nine total points that's NINTH place folks NINTH out of twelve that's danger territory that's DEFCON THREE that's time to reassess your entire bidding strategy!

### **LOT NUMBER FOUR: CAL'S MASTERPIECE (ALREADY DISCUSSED)**

One-thirty-seven to seventy-nine-point-five Cal over Aaron by FIFTY-SEVEN-POINT-FIVE we already covered this MAGNIFICENT performance but let me just add Aaron is now ZERO AND SIX folks WINLESS absolutely WINLESS with only four-eighty-four total points dead LAST in our standings! Despite having Jayden Daniels score TWENTY-FOUR and Jaxson Dart add TWENTY-TWO that's FORTY-SIX from quarterbacks but when your TOTAL is seventy-nine-point-five you've got PROBLEMS major PROBLEMS like trying to bid at Sotheby's with Monopoly money!

### **LOT NUMBER FIVE: BRUCE'S BUDGET BRILLIANCE**

One-oh-three to FIFTY do I hear fifty-one fifty-one anybody no it's FIFTY to Mike and one-oh-three to Bruce that's a FIFTY-THREE point differential folks Bruce absolutely CRUSHING Mike like a steamroller over a grape! Bruce had Drake Maye throwing for TWENTY-SIX Daniel Jones adding TWENTY-FOUR that's FIFTY POINTS just from quarterbacks FIFTY that's what we call CORNER THE MARKET in the auction business!

Mike scoring only FIFTY points that's the LOWEST score of the week folks the absolute BASEMENT BARGAIN BIN score with Alvin Kamara Quinshon Judkins Tyjae Spears ALL scoring ZERO that's THREE running backs with NOTHING a TRIPLE GOOSE EGG an OMELET of disappointment! Mike sits at ONE AND FIVE folks that's TENTH place that's CRISIS MODE that's time to throw out the whole playbook and start OVER!

Bruce meanwhile moves to THREE AND THREE with five-ninety-nine-point-five total points good for FOURTH place still in the hunt still ALIVE still got a paddle to raise in this auction house! This win this STATEMENT victory that's the kind of momentum that can turn a season around faster than an auctioneer's tongue!

### **LOT NUMBER SIX: SEAN'S SMALL CONSOLATION**

Sixty-seven-point-five to sixty-five going once going twice SOLD to Eli by two-point-five points the SECOND closest matchup of the week folks another NAIL-BITER another HEART-STOPPER! Patrick Mahomes showing why he's the PREMIUM lot with THIRTY-TWO POINTS the highest individual score of the week but even THAT wasn't enough to overcome the rest of Eli's roster struggles!

Sean scoring sixty-five that's BELOW the weekly average that's DISCOUNT pricing that's the clearance rack but hey a loss by two-point-five feels a lot better than a loss by FIFTY! Both teams struggling both teams fighting both teams trying to stay relevant in this auction house! Eli moves to FOUR AND TWO with five-twenty-three-point-five total points Sean drops to TWO AND FOUR with five-twelve total points!

## **THE PERFORMANCE TIERS: SEPARATING PLATINUM FROM PEWTER**

Now folks let me break down the INVENTORY let me show you the LOTS let me categorize these collections for your viewing pleasure! We've got FOUR distinct tiers in our auction house FOUR levels of quality from the PREMIUM PLATINUM all the way down to the BARGAIN BASEMENT!

**THE PLATINUM COLLECTION** (130+ points): We had THREE teams in this EXCLUSIVE tier this week Cal with one-thirty-seven Joe with one-thirty-six-point-five Chris with one-twenty-two-point-five these are your BLUE CHIPS your PREMIUM INVESTMENTS your FIRST EDITION MINT CONDITION rosters! When you're scoring over one-thirty you're not just participating you're DOMINATING you're setting the MARKET PRICE you're making everyone else JEALOUS! That's TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT of the league in the elite tier folks that's a BULL MARKET that's prosperity that's ABUNDANCE!

**THE GOLD STANDARD** (80-129 points): Just Bruce holding it down with one-oh-three points SOLID GOLD not platinum but still VALUABLE still worth having in your portfolio! This is your steady investment your municipal bonds your blue-collar honest work that gets the job done without the FLASH without the PIZZAZZ but with RESULTS! Bruce proving you don't need one-thirty to win you just need to score more than your opponent and when your opponent scores FIFTY well one-oh-three looks like a MILLION BUCKS!

**THE SILVER SURVIVORS** (60-79 points): We've got a CROWDED field here folks Aaron with seventy-nine-point-five Eli with sixty-seven-point-five Matt with sixty-seven Pete with sixty-five that's FOUR teams FOUR owners all hovering in this danger zone this TWILIGHT zone where you're not quite terrible but you're certainly not GOOD! This is where dreams go to die folks where playoff hopes start to fade where you start thinking about next year's draft! When ONE-THIRD of the league is scoring under eighty points that's a RECESSION that's a BEAR MARKET that's trouble with a capital T!

**THE BASEMENT BARGAINS** (Below 60 points): Dan with fifty-two-point-five Mitch with fifty-seven Mike with FIFTY that's THREE teams folks TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT of the league scoring under sixty points that's not just bad that's HISTORICALLY bad that's the kind of performance that has you checking the WAIVER WIRE at three in the morning wondering where it all went WRONG! When you're scoring in the fifties you're not competing you're just SURVIVING you're just trying to make it through without complete EMBARRASSMENT!

## **THE BUST BRIGADE: WHEN PREMIUM PICKS TURN TO FOOL'S GOLD**

Now folks we need to talk about the DISASTERS the CATASTROPHES the absolute MONEY PITS of week six! We had FIFTEEN players FIFTEEN supposed STUDS scoring ZERO POINTS that's not a bust that's a BANKRUPTCY that's a LIQUIDATION SALE that's throwing good money after BAD!

The QUARTERBACK catastrophe Justin Fields scoring ZERO Russell Wilson scoring ZERO these are supposed to be your STEADY EARNERS your RELIABLE INCOME and they gave you NOTHING ZILCH NADA like bidding on a painting that turns out to be a FORGERY! 

But the RUNNING BACK room that's where the real TRAGEDY struck folks we had Brian Robinson Jr Kareem Hunt Samaje Perine Tyrone Tracy Jr Dylan Sampson David Montgomery TreVeyon Henderson Tony Pollard RJ Harvey Ollie Gordon II Alvin Kamara Quinshon Judkins Tyjae Spears ALL SCORING ZERO that's THIRTEEN running backs folks THIRTEEN that's not a position group that's a SUPPORT GROUP that's a DISASTER RELIEF ZONE!

When you've got supposed premium assets like Alvin Kamara and David Montgomery scoring ZEROS that's like buying a Rolex and finding out it's a TIMEX that's like bidding on a Ferrari and getting a FORD PINTO! These owners thought they had BLUE CHIPS and ended up with PENNY STOCKS!

---

## **CLOSE CALLS AND HEARTBREAKERS: WHEN EVERY POINT COUNTS**

Let me tell you about the PHOTO FINISHES folks the ones that came down to the WIRE down to the very LAST DECIMAL POINT! Mitch beating Dan by four-point-five that's NOTHING that's one catch that's one field goal that's the difference between VICTORY and DEFEAT! Eli squeaking past Sean by two-point-five even CLOSER even TIGHTER that's the kind of margin that has you reviewing EVERY lineup decision wondering what if WHAT IF you'd started someone else!

In the auction house of fantasy football every point is a DOLLAR every yard is a DIME every touchdown is a TWENTY and when you lose by less than FIVE points that's like being outbid by a SINGLE DOLLAR on a million-dollar painting! Dan and Sean both probably lying awake at night thinking about that ONE PLAYER they should have started that ONE DECISION that cost them EVERYTHING!

---

## **LOOKING AHEAD: THE AUCTION CONTINUES**

Now folks as we head into week seven let me tell you what's on the BLOCK what's coming up for AUCTION what you need to keep your eyes on! Joe's team sitting at the TOP with seven-thirty-five points but Chris is RIGHT THERE with six-ninety-two-point-five that's only a forty-two-point-five difference folks that's NOTHING that's one bad week that's one good week that's the difference between FIRST and SECOND!

The PLAYOFF RACE is heating up faster than a Texas parking lot in August! We've got Aaron at ZERO AND SIX that's DONE that's FINISHED that's time to start thinking about the CONSOLATION PRIZES! Mike at ONE AND FIVE not much better that's LIFE SUPPORT that's CRITICAL CONDITION that's praying for a MIRACLE RUN that probably ain't coming!

But the MIDDLE folks the MIDDLE is where the ACTION is! We've got FIVE teams sitting at either three-and-three or two-and-four that's FIVE teams within striking distance of the playoffs FIVE teams who could go either way FIVE teams where every week every matchup every POINT matters like it's the LAST DOLLAR at the auction!
