# 📯 HEAR YE, HEAR YE! A PROCLAMATION OF THE SIXTH FORTNIGHT'S FANTASY BATTLES! 📯

## By Royal Decree of the Fantasy Realm, Let It Be Known Throughout the Land!

### 🏰 The Setting of Our Tale - A Kingdom Divided

Hear ye, hear ye, good citizens of our fair fantasy realm! Gather 'round the town square and lend thine ears to this most momentous proclamation! By the grace of the Fantasy Gods and the sacred scrolls of statistics, I bring thee tidings from the sixth week of battles in the year of our lord two thousand and twenty-five! The autumn winds have blown fierce across our kingdom, and with them come tales of triumph and tragedy, of mighty warriors who soared like dragons and those who fell like stones from castle walls!

Verily, this week hath separated the wheat from the chaff, the nobles from the peasants, the blessed from the cursed! For in this sixth fortnight, we witnessed scores most wondrous and terrible - from the mighty Sir Calvin commanding 137 points with his noble army, to poor Lord Michael, who could muster but a mere 50 points, barely enough to feed a stable of horses! The realm trembles at such disparity!

Lo, as thy humble town crier stands upon this wooden platform, bell in hand, I must declare that never before in this season have we witnessed such a chasm between the mighty and the meek! The average lord scored but 89 points in this fortnight, yet some soared to heights of 137 whilst others wallowed in the mire at 50! Truly, the Fantasy Gods show no mercy!

### 👑 The Royal Court's Highest Honor - Sir Calvin's Glorious Conquest!

HEAR YE! HEAR YE! Let trumpets sound from every tower and bells ring from every steeple! Sir Calvin of House Cal hath claimed the crown of the week with a most magnificent 137 points! His army, led by the valiant Caleb Williams of Chicago (22 points) and the mighty Bijan Robinson of Atlanta (23 points), did storm across the battlefield like a plague of locusts, leaving naught but devastation in their wake!

But hark! 'Twas not without cost, for even in victory, Sir Calvin's forces suffered grievous wounds! His warriors Tyrone Tracy Jr., Emeka Egbuka, Keon Coleman, Dylan Sampson, and Kyle Pitts Sr. all fell upon the field, scoring not a single point! Yet such is the depth of Sir Calvin's war chest that even with five warriors fallen, he still claimed the second-highest score of the fortnight! Verily, 'tis like watching a knight win a joust with one arm tied behind his back!

The scribes shall record in the annals of history that Sir Calvin's 137-point performance stands as a monument to strategic brilliance! Despite losing nearly a third of his active roster to the cruel whims of fate, he still vanquished Lord Aaron's forces by a margin of 57.5 points! 'Twas less a battle and more a public execution in the town square!

### ⚔️ The Great Battles of the Sixth Fortnight

#### **The Massacre at Joe's Keep - Joe's Team (136.5) vs Pete's Team (89.0)**

HEAR YE! Lord Joseph, sitting tied atop the kingdom's standings with five victories, did unleash unholy fury upon poor Lord Peter! With Rico Dowdle of Carolina galloping for 23 points like a destrier possessed by demons, Lord Joseph's army scored 136.5 points - merely half a point shy of the week's crown! 

Lord Peter, already bearing the scars of four defeats, fought valiantly but 'twas like bringing a butter knife to a siege! His forces managed 89 points, respectable for a peasant perhaps, but woefully inadequate against Lord Joseph's war machine! The 47.5-point differential was so vast that cartographers are adding it to their maps as a new canyon! Brandon Aiyuk's absence due to injury left a hole in Lord Peter's ranks larger than the moat around the castle!

This victory solidifies Lord Joseph's claim to the throne with 735 total points across six weeks - an average of 122.5 points per fortnight! At this pace, he threatens to become the realm's first true tyrant! Meanwhile, Lord Peter sinks deeper into the quicksand of mediocrity with but two victories to show for his efforts!

#### **The Noble Decimation - Chris's Team (122.5) vs Matt's Team (67.0)**

SOUND THE HORNS! Lord Christopher, that master tactician, did thoroughly embarrass Lord Matthew in a display of dominance that had mothers covering their children's eyes! With the trio of Josh Jacobs (25 points), De'Von Achane (25 points), and Dak Prescott (24 points) combining for 74 points alone, 'twas like watching a master swordsman duel a scarecrow!

Lord Matthew's forces, decimated by the loss of Tyler Bass to the injured reserve and managing only 67 points total, looked more like a funeral procession than an army! Even young Bryce Young's 21 points couldn't save this sinking ship! The 55.5-point thrashing was so severe that Lord Matthew's team physician has prescribed bed rest and strong ale!

Lord Christopher now stands tall with five victories, his 692.5 total points marking him as a true contender for the crown! Lord Matthew, despite four wins, must surely question whether the Fantasy Gods have forsaken him after such a humiliating defeat! His average of 88.7 points per week suggests storms ahead!

#### **The Peasant's Upset - Bruce's Team (103.0) vs Mike's Team (50.0)**

BY THE SEVEN KINGDOMS! Lord Bruce did rise from his middling station to deliver unto Lord Michael the most devastating defeat of the fortnight! With Drake Maye (26 points) and Daniel Jones (24 points) leading the charge, Lord Bruce's 103 points felt like a king's ransom compared to Lord Michael's pathetic 50!

Lord Michael's performance - nay, let us call it what it truly was - his CATASTROPHE, stands as the lowest score of the entire week! Fifty points! FIFTY! There are tavern wenches who could assemble a better roster whilst blindfolded and three sheets to the wind! This 53-point shellacking shall echo through the ages as a cautionary tale!

Lord Bruce, now with three victories and renewed vigor, has shown that even a modest lord can become a giant-slayer! Meanwhile, Lord Michael wallows in the dungeon of the standings with but one victory in six attempts! His 503.5 total points are an embarrassment to his house and lineage!

#### **The Blade's Edge Victory - Mitch's Team (57.0) vs Dan's Team (52.5)**

HEAR YE! In a battle so close that even the royal accountants needed their spectacles cleaned twice, Lord Mitchell prevailed over Lord Daniel by a mere 4.5 points! 'Twas a contest that resembled two one-legged knights attempting to joust - neither particularly graceful, but someone had to win!

Lord Mitchell's victory came despite a roster ravaged by the plague! Lamar Jackson lies wounded, George Kittle rests in the infirmary, and SIX of his active warriors - Puka Nacua, Brian Robinson Jr., Stefon Diggs, Kareem Hunt, Keenan Allen, and Xavier Legette - scored ZERO points! Yet somehow, Cam Skattebo's heroic 30-point performance was enough to drag this corpse of a roster across the finish line!

Lord Daniel, whose Jalen Hurts managed 22 points, must feel like a man who lost his fortune betting on the wrong rooster at the cockfight! His 52.5 points represent the second-lowest score of the week, a performance so putrid that even the stable boys mock him! Both lords now stand at 3-3, locked in mediocrity's firm embrace!

#### **The Duel of the Desperate - Eli's Team (67.5) vs Sean's Team (65.0)**

PROCLAMATION! In what can only be described as watching two drowning men fight over a piece of driftwood, Lord Eli narrowly escaped with a 2.5-point victory over Lord Sean! Patrick Mahomes' 32 points for Lord Eli proved the difference in this battle of the basement dwellers!

Lord Eli's roster, decimated by injuries to Joe Mixon, Omarion Hampton, and Trey Benson, still managed to scratch out 67.5 points! Meanwhile, Lord Sean, with Miles Sanders joining the ranks of the wounded, could muster only 65 points! 'Twas like watching two beggars fight over a copper piece!

Both lords showed why they languish in the middle depths of our kingdom! Lord Eli rises to 4-2, while Lord Sean falls to 2-4, but neither performance would strike fear into the heart of even the most cowardly opponent!

### 📊 The Royal Census - Tiers of the Realm

#### **The Noble Elite (130+ Points)**
- Sir Calvin's Army: 137 points - Crown of the Week! 
- Lord Joseph's Forces: 136.5 points - The Consistent Tyrant!

These two titans stand above all others like mountains above molehills! Their combined 273.5 points could have defeated any three lesser teams!

#### **The Merchant Class (100-129 Points)**
- Lord Christopher's Brigade: 122.5 points - The Rising Power!
- Lord Bruce's Battalion: 103.0 points - The Giant Slayer!

Respectable showings from these lords, proving that consistency and smart generalship can overcome adversity!

#### **The Struggling Serfs (60-99 Points)**
- Lord Peter's Platoon: 89.0 points - Fought with honor despite defeat!
- Lord Aaron's Assembly: 79.5 points - Another week, another loss!
- Lord Matthew's Militia: 67.0 points - A shameful showing!
- Lord Eli's Ensemble: 67.5 points - Barely breathing!
- Lord Sean's Squadron: 65.0 points - Approaching rock bottom!

These lords must surely be questioning their life choices and considering a career in agriculture instead!

#### **The Dungeon Dwellers (Below 60 Points)**
- Lord Mitchell's Mob: 57.0 points - Won ugly, but won nonetheless!
- Lord Daniel's Detachment: 52.5 points - Second worst of the week!
- Lord Michael's Miscreants: 50.0 points - THE ABSOLUTE WORST!

These three performances were so poor that the royal executioner has been put on standby!

### 💔 The Hall of Shame - Warriors Who Failed Their Lords

HEAR YE! Let the following names be spoken with derision and disappointment! These supposed champions scored ZERO points, bringing shame upon their houses:

From House Mitch - **SEVEN FAILURES**: Puka Nacua, Brian Robinson Jr., Stefon Diggs, Kareem Hunt, Keenan Allen, Xavier Legette, and Samaje Perine! Never before has one roster contained so much failure!

From House Cal - **FIVE FAILURES**: Tyrone Tracy Jr., Emeka Egbuka, Keon Coleman, Dylan Sampson, and Kyle Pitts Sr.! Even in victory, these cowards showed no heart!

From House Eli - **THREE FAILURES**: Amon-Ra St. Brown, David Montgomery, and TreVeyon Henderson! The mighty Lions of Detroit have become lambs!

### ⚔️ Tales of Close Combat and Heartbreak

The battle between Lord Mitchell and Lord Daniel (4.5 points) was closer than two fleas on a dog's back! Had Lord Daniel's quarterback thrown but one more touchdown pass, the tables would have turned! 

Lord Eli's narrow 2.5-point escape from Lord Sean was so close that the royal mathematicians had to use their finest abacus! One field goal different and Lord Sean celebrates whilst Lord Eli weeps!

These razor-thin margins remind us all that in the realm of fantasy, fortune favors the bold, but sometimes she merely favors the slightly less incompetent!

### 🔮 Gazing Into the Crystal Ball - The Road Ahead

HEAR YE! As we approach the seventh fortnight, the kingdom's hierarchy becomes clear:

**The Ascendant Throne Seekers**: Lords Joseph and Christopher, both at 5-1, have separated themselves from the rabble like oil from water! Their consistent excellence suggests a collision course for the crown!

**The Contenders**: Lord Calvin (4-2) has shown he can score with the best, while Lords Matthew and Eli (4-2) need consistency to remain relevant!

**The Muddled Middle**: Lords Bruce, Daniel, and Mitchell (all 3-3) float in purgatory, neither blessed nor completely damned!

**The Desperate**: Lords Peter and Sean (2-4) grow desperate as the season's hourglass empties!

**The Disgraced**: Lords Michael (1-5) and Aaron (0-6) should consider fleeing the realm under cover of darkness! Lord Aaron remains the only lord without a single victory - a mark of shame that shall follow him to his grave!

### 🏥 The Royal Infirmary Report - Warriors on the Mend

BY DECREE, let it be known that the following warriors lie wounded or upon their sickbeds:

**House Chris**: Dalton Kincaid (Out - Oblique injury)

**House Eli**: Joe Mixon (Out - Foot/Ankle, questionable for season), Omarion Hampton (IR - Ankle), Trey Benson (IR - Knee)

**House Matt**: Tyler Bass (IR - Hip/Groin)

**House Mitch**: George Kittle (IR - Hamstring, may return soon), Lamar Jackson (Out - Hamstring, expected Week 8)

**House Pete**: Brandon Aiyuk (Out - Knee, timeline uncertain)

**House Sean**: Miles Sanders (IR - Knee/Ankle)

### 📜 The Final Royal Proclamation

HEAR YE! HEAR YE! Let it be known throughout the land that the sixth fortnight of our fantasy campaign has revealed both heroes and cowards, geniuses and fools! Lord Joseph and Lord Christopher lead our realm with iron fists and full coffers! Lord Calvin proved that even with wounded soldiers, a true general finds victory! Lord Bruce showed that even the humble can rise up and smite the weak!

But let us also remember the fallen! Lord Michael's 50-point disaster shall be carved into the Pillar of Shame! Lord Aaron's winless record grows more embarrassing with each passing week - surely he must consider abdication! Lord Mitchell's victory, built upon the rubble of seven scoreless players, was less triumph and more survival!

As we march toward the seventh week of battle, remember this, good citizens: In the realm of fantasy football, today's king can become tomorrow's fool, and today's fool might yet wear the crown! The Fantasy Gods are fickle mistresses who care not for reputation nor past glory!

Until next fortnight, may your rosters be healthy, your matchups favorable, and may you never suffer the indignity of scoring only 50 points!

**BY ORDER OF THE REALM,**
*Your Humble Town Crier*

*Ring Ring* 🔔 *Ring Ring* 🔔

*Thus concludes this proclamation on this sixteenth day of October, in the year of our lord 2025. Let any who dispute these words meet me at the stocks for a proper quarrel!*
