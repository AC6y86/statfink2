# The StatFink Fantasy Football Thanksgiving Day Parade Spectacular

## Week 11, 2025 Season

---

*LIVE from the Streets of Fantasy Football Boulevard*

**Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and WELCOME to the most spectacular parade event of the fantasy football season!** I'm your parade announcer, the Commissioner himself, coming to you LIVE from the reviewing stand as we celebrate Week 11 of the 2025 StatFink Fantasy Football season! The confetti is flying, the bands are warming up, and folks, do we have a SHOW for you today! 

The streets are lined with fantasy faithful bundled up in their jerseys, hot cocoa in hand, awaiting the procession of six magnificent floats representing today's matchups. But make no mistake -- not every float will glide smoothly down this boulevard. Some will soar majestically, while others... well, let's just say our cleanup crew is standing by with brooms and consolation tissues. The league average this week came in at a humble 95.4 points, but as you'll see, some teams soared FAR above that line while others couldn't even see it from where they were crawling.

Let the parade BEGIN!

## THE HEADLINER FLOAT: Chris's Team Towers Over All

### The Josh Allen Balloon Extravaganza (166.5 Total Points)

**OH MY STARS AND GARTERS, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT!** 

Leading our parade today is the most MAGNIFICENT display of fantasy football dominance we have seen all season! Chris's Team has constructed what can only be described as a CATHEDRAL on wheels, towering three stories high and absolutely dripping with gold leaf and championship aspirations. And floating above it all, casting a shadow over the entire parade route, is the ENORMOUS Josh Allen balloon -- a helium-filled colossus of football brilliance!

Josh Allen put on an ABSOLUTE CLINIC this week, folks, racking up a league-leading 48.0 fantasy points! The Bills quarterback was throwing darts, scrambling for his life, and making defensive coordinators weep into their headsets. His balloon floats so high above the parade that small aircraft have been diverted! But wait -- there's MORE floating up there! Dak Prescott came alive with 29.0 points, proving that even Cowboys can ride on Buffalo floats when the points are this good. And who's that emerging from behind the main attraction? It's rookie sensation TreVeyon Henderson, contributing a very respectable 27.0 points of his own!

Chris's Team absolutely ANNIHILATED the league average of 95.4 points, nearly DOUBLING it with their 166.5-point masterpiece. With a 9-2 record and 1,409 total points on the season, this float isn't just winning the parade -- it's threatening to run away with the whole darn championship trophy. The crowd is showering them with roses, the marching band is playing "We Are the Champions," and somewhere, the other eleven owners are wondering how they're supposed to compete with THIS.

---

## FLOAT #1: Chris's Team vs. Eli's Team

### "The Massacre on Main Street" (155.0 - 79.0)

And here comes our first official matchup float, folks, and OH DEAR, someone call the paramedics because what we're witnessing is less of a parade and more of a DEMOLITION DERBY!

On one side of this dual float, Chris's Team rides high and proud, their section absolutely GLEAMING with that dominant 155.0 net points (after defensive bonuses are applied). Josh Allen's 48.0 points alone would have nearly beaten Eli's entire squad! The float is so weighted down with points that the wheels are leaving grooves in the pavement. Dak Prescott (29.0), TreVeyon Henderson (27.0), and Jameson Williams (14.0) are all waving to the crowd like conquering heroes returning from war.

But turning our attention to the OTHER half of this float... oh my. OH MY. Eli's Team has experienced what parade officials are calling a "catastrophic structural failure." The float is LIMPING down the route, held together by duct tape and broken dreams, managing only 79.0 measly points. Kenneth Gainwell tried his best with 22.0 points, and Trey McBride contributed 17.0, but folks, when Amon-Ra St. Brown, David Montgomery, Tua Tagovailoa, Darnell Mooney, AND T.J. Hockenson ALL put up goose eggs? That's not a float -- that's a CRIME SCENE! Seven players scoring ZERO points! The crowd is tossing sympathy candy instead of celebration streamers.

This 76-point blowout drops Eli to 5-6 on the season. Their playoff hopes haven't deflated -- they've POPPED, spectacularly, in front of thousands of horrified spectators. Chris, meanwhile, cements his position atop the standings at 9-2. The gap between these two teams was so vast that Eli's float actually disappeared over the horizon before Chris's even rounded the first corner.

---

## FLOAT #2: Mitch's Team vs. Sean's Team

### "The Battle of the Basement Neighbors" (93.0 - 76.0)

Here comes a float that's... well... let's be charitable and call it "modest," shall we?

Mitch's Team takes this matchup with 93.0 net points, which -- while not setting the world on fire -- was EXACTLY enough to beat Sean's struggling 76.0-point effort. The Niners connection proved crucial for Mitch, as Brock Purdy (21.0 points) and George Kittle (19.0 points) carried the weight of this float on their considerable shoulders. Xavier Legette chipped in 14.0, and Kareem Hunt added 11.0 from the backfield.

However, this float also showcased some MAJOR parade mishaps! Chuba Hubbard (0.0), Brian Robinson Jr. (0.0), and Cooper Kupp (0.0) were supposed to be dancing on the float, but instead they're just... standing there. Motionless. Like those creepy animatronic figures that stopped working mid-routine. The crowd doesn't know whether to clap or call an exorcist.

Sean's Team brought even LESS to the party. Travis Etienne Jr. was the bright spot with 19.0 points, and Devin Singletary contributed 16.0, but after that? The cupboard was BARE. Justin Jefferson, the supposed superstar, managed only 3.0 points -- his balloon didn't so much deflate as IMPLODE, sending rubber shrapnel into the crowd! Breece Hall (3.0) and Jaylen Waddle (3.0) were equally disappointing, their mini-balloons barely rising above ankle height.

Mitch improves to 5-6 while Sean falls to a dismal 3-8. Neither team is exactly parade-ready for the postseason, but at least Mitch is still technically in the conversation. Sean? His float has a flat tire and the engine's making a very concerning noise.

---

## FLOAT #3: Dan's Team vs. Cal's Team

### "The Upset Special with Extra Gravy" (98.0 - 109.5)

HOLD ONTO YOUR TURKEY LEGS, FOLKS, because THIS float is coming in HOT with an upset victory!

Cal's Team has pulled off a spectacular Week 11 performance, their float BURSTING with autumn colors and that sweet, sweet 109.5-point victory! Leading the charge is the magnificent Bijan Robinson balloon, floating regally with 25.0 points worth of helium! There's also a mysterious 16.0-point defensive balloon up there, and Trevor Lawrence contributed 13.0 points to keep this machine running smoothly. Drake London (9.0), Jaxon Smith-Njigba (9.0), and Tyrone Tracy Jr. (9.0) form a beautiful supporting chorus line on the float deck.

But wait -- some of Cal's performers didn't show up for work today! Ashton Jeanty, Emeka Egbuka, Dylan Sampson, and Kyle Pitts all posted ZEROS, yet Cal STILL managed to claim victory! The crowd gasps at the raw talent depth on display!

Dan's Team put together a solid 98.0 net points, which would have been good enough against most opponents this week. Kyren Williams (14.0), Kenneth Walker III (11.0), Deebo Samuel (11.0), and Geno Smith (11.0) all contributed respectable numbers. Marcus Mariota even chipped in 11.0 off the bench! But when Saquon Barkley -- SAQUON BARKLEY! -- only manages 6.0 points, and Blake Corum and Khalil Shakir both goose-egg you? The parade route gets bumpy real fast.

Cal improves to 6-5 with this win, keeping playoff dreams alive and well. Dan drops to 4-7, and their float is now smoking from the engine compartment. Someone get the fire extinguisher!

---

## FLOAT #4: Pete's Team vs. Aaron's Team

### "The Sean Tucker Aerial Spectacular" (98.0 - 60.0)

NOW THIS is a parade float, folks!

Pete's Team cruises past Aaron's struggling squad with a comfortable 98.0-point victory, propelled largely by the MASSIVE Sean Tucker balloon hovering overhead! Tucker absolutely EXPLODED this week for 33.0 points, and his balloon is so big that birds are nesting in it! This performance alone was more than half of what Aaron's entire team managed!

Supporting Tucker in this aerial display, we have Nico Collins (14.0), Jared Goff (14.0), and the ageless Travis Kelce (14.0), forming a beautiful formation of medium-sized balloons. Matthew Stafford contributed 10.0 points as well. Pete's float is steady, reliable, and cruising at exactly the league average of 98 points -- nothing spectacular, but EXACTLY enough to handle business.

Aaron's Team, on the other hand... oh dear. Their float is more like a go-kart held together by rubber bands and wishful thinking. Tetairoa McMillan tried his ABSOLUTE BEST with 25.0 points (nearly half the team total!), but when your next-best performers are Mark Andrews and Bam Knight at 8.0 points each? You're in trouble, friend. Zach Charbonnet (0.0) and Tank Bigsby (0.0) were supposed to be the running back feature performers, but they're currently sitting on the curb eating parade peanuts instead of contributing.

Pete improves to 6-5 and stays in the playoff hunt. Aaron drops to a basement-dwelling 2-9, their float so low-powered it's actually being pushed by volunteers at this point. The crowd is giving them polite, sympathetic applause -- the fantasy football equivalent of a participation trophy.

---

## FLOAT #5: Joe's Team vs. Mike's Team

### "The Elite Versus the Struggling" (91.0 - 65.5)

Ladies and gentlemen, here comes one of the league's POWERHOUSE floats, though today it's running on just half its cylinders!

Joe's Team takes the victory with 91.0 net points -- below their stellar season average of 121.9 points, but MORE than enough to handle Mike's 65.5-point whimper. The star of this float? JACOBY BRISSETT, of all people, with 25.0 points! That's right, the journeyman backup quarterback is floating overhead like a magnificent, unexpected turkey surprise! George Pickens added 17.0 points from the Dallas game, and Justin Fields contributed 16.0 from his new home in New York.

However, Joe's float experienced some technical difficulties. Ladd McConkey (0.0), Xavier Worthy (0.0), Christian Kirk (0.0), Wan'Dale Robinson (0.0), Dallas Goedert (0.0), and Cade Otton (0.0) all failed to contribute ANYTHING! That's SIX goose eggs on an elite team! The parade technicians are BAFFLED how this float is even still moving! Joe's dominance this season is so strong that he can afford to have half his roster take a bye week and STILL cruise to victory.

Mike's Team never had a chance. Baker Mayfield (13.0) and Jordan Love (12.0) provided some quarterback production, and Tee Higgins managed 11.0 points despite being OUT with a concussion (those must be injury-delayed points from an earlier game). But Jahmyr Gibbs at only 9.0 points? Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Tyjae Spears, Mason Taylor all at 0.0? The deflation was audible from the reviewing stand.

Joe improves to a league-best 9-2, tied with Chris atop the standings! Mike falls to 4-7, his playoff hopes essentially parade confetti at this point -- colorful to look at, but ultimately just trash to be swept away.

---

## FLOAT #6: Bruce's Team vs. Matt's Team

### "The Bryce Young Redemption Tour" (67.5 - 94.0)

Our final float of the parade brings us a story of REDEMPTION, folks!

Matt's Team coasts to a 94.0-point victory behind the STUNNING performance of former bust Bryce Young, who put up 32.0 points and has his very own balloon floating PROUDLY above the float! Wasn't it just last year this kid was being called the biggest draft disappointment in NFL history? Well, today he's a fantasy HERO! Alongside Bryce, Christian McCaffrey reminded everyone why he was the top pick in dynasty leagues with 30.0 points -- pure excellence from the San Francisco superstar! Derrick Henry added a workmanlike 17.0 points.

But here's the thing about Matt's float -- after those three studs, it's a GHOST TOWN! A.J. Brown (0.0), DJ Moore (0.0), DeVonta Smith (0.0), Jerome Ford (0.0), and Rashid Shaheed (0.0) are all just standing motionless on the float like scarecrows at a haunted harvest festival. The top three carried the ENTIRE burden this week!

Bruce's Team simply couldn't keep up with their meager 67.5 points. Drake Maye led the way with 14.0 points, and Bhayshul Tuten added 11.0, but the depth just wasn't there. Ja'Marr Chase putting up a ZERO? DK Metcalf at ZERO? Nick Chubb and Jerry Jeudy combining for ZERO? Bruce's float isn't deflating -- it's actively SINKING into the pavement like some kind of fantasy football sinkhole!

Matt improves to 7-4 with this win, firmly in the playoff conversation! Bruce falls to 6-5, still alive but definitely on the bubble. Their float will need SERIOUS repairs before next week.

## Performance Tier Analysis: The Balloon Height Chart

### THE GOODYEAR ELITE (Above 100 Points)
At the TOP of our parade, floating so high they're practically in the stratosphere:
- **Chris's Team: 166.5 points** -- The undisputed King of the Parade
- **Cal's Team: 109.5 points** -- A surprising contender joining the upper atmosphere

These two floats are so magnificent they have their own weather systems forming around them! The gap between Chris (166.5) and second-place Cal (109.5) is a STAGGERING 57 points -- nearly an entire respectable team's output!

### THE STEADY MARCHERS (85-100 Points)
The reliable middle of the pack, neither embarrassing nor spectacular:
- **Mitch's Team: 104.0 points**
- **Dan's Team: 103.0 points**
- **Matt's Team: 99.0 points**
- **Joe's Team: 99.0 points**
- **Pete's Team: 98.0 points**

These five teams clustered RIGHT around the league average (95.4 points), like a perfectly synchronized marching band. Respectable. Dependable. The fantasy equivalent of a solid casserole at Thanksgiving dinner -- not the turkey, but no one's complaining either.

### THE DEFLATING DISASTERS (Below 85 Points)
Someone get these floats to the repair shop IMMEDIATELY:
- **Sean's Team: 80.0 points**
- **Eli's Team: 79.0 points**
- **Bruce's Team: 73.5 points**
- **Mike's Team: 70.0 points**
- **Aaron's Team: 60.0 points**

Five teams -- nearly HALF THE LEAGUE -- couldn't crack 85 points this week! Aaron's 60.0 points is absolutely DISMAL, the kind of score that gets your parade permit revoked and your float impounded!

## The Bust Brigade: Balloons That Popped

Oh, the humanity! So many star players whose balloons just... EXPLODED mid-parade:

- **Amon-Ra St. Brown (Eli's Team): 0.0 points** -- The Sun God's balloon caught fire and crashed into a Starbucks!
- **Ja'Marr Chase (Bruce's Team): 0.0 points** -- The Bengal's balloon deflated faster than their playoff hopes!
- **Josh Jacobs (Chris's Team): 0.0 points** -- Even champions have their parade mishaps!
- **Saquon Barkley (Dan's Team): 6.0 points** -- Not zero, but for SAQUON? Might as well be!
- **Justin Jefferson (Sean's Team): 3.0 points** -- The Vikings' star looked more like a Vikings VICTIM!
- **Breece Hall (Sean's Team): 3.0 points** -- The Jets' RB1 sputtered out of gas mid-route!
- **David Montgomery (Eli's Team): 0.0 points** -- Detroit's smashmouth runner apparently took the day off!

---

## Close Calls and Heartbreakers

The closest matchup of the week? Mitch over Sean by 17 points (93-76). Not exactly a nail-biter, but when both teams are struggling, every point counts! 

The Cal over Dan upset (109.5-98.0) was the most COMPETITIVE quality matchup, with both teams actually showing up to play. Dan HAD to be kicking himself watching Bijan Robinson (25.0) and Cal's defense rack up points while his supposed studs underperformed.

The biggest blowout? Chris DESTROYED Eli by 76 points (155-79). That's not a parade -- that's a FUNERAL PROCESSION for Eli's season!

## The Standings After Week 11

| Rank | Team | Owner | Record | Season Points |
|------|------|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Chris's Team | Chris | 9-2 | 1,409.0 |
| 2 | Joe's Team | Joe | 9-2 | 1,341.5 |
| 3 | Matt's Team | Matt | 7-4 | 964.0 |
| 4 | Cal's Team | Cal | 6-5 | 1,151.0 |
| 5 | Bruce's Team | Bruce | 6-5 | 1,074.5 |
| 6 | Pete's Team | Pete | 6-5 | 992.5 |
| 7 | Eli's Team | Eli | 5-6 | 897.0 |
| 8 | Mitch's Team | Mitch | 5-6 | 892.5 |
| 9 | Dan's Team | Dan | 4-7 | 990.0 |
| 10 | Mike's Team | Mike | 4-7 | 955.0 |
| 11 | Sean's Team | Sean | 3-8 | 1,032.0 |
| 12 | Aaron's Team | Aaron | 2-9 | 875.5 |

The playoff picture is HEATING UP! Chris and Joe are running away with the top two seeds, but positions 3-8 are a MESS! Only two games separate 3rd place Matt from 8th place Mitch! Every week matters now, folks!

---

## Looking Ahead: The Playoff Push

With the regular season winding down, the playoff implications are MASSIVE! 

**Locked In:** Chris (9-2) and Joe (9-2) have essentially clinched playoff berths. They're riding their floats straight to the postseason with room to spare.

**Fighting for Position:** Matt (7-4), Cal (6-5), Bruce (6-5), and Pete (6-5) are all jockeying for those crucial middle playoff spots. One bad week could spell disaster!

**On Life Support:** Eli (5-6) and Mitch (5-6) need to start winning NOW or their parade routes will lead straight to the consolation bracket.

**Mathematically Alive But Spiritually Dead:** Dan (4-7), Mike (4-7), Sean (3-8), and Aaron (2-9) would need MIRACLES to make the postseason. Their floats are basically being towed at this point.

## Final Thoughts from the Commissioner's Stand

What a SPECTACULAR Week 11 we've witnessed, folks! The Josh Allen balloon will be talked about for YEARS! The Bryce Young redemption float brought tears to our eyes! And the absolute CARNAGE inflicted upon Eli's Team... well, that brought tears to Eli's eyes for entirely different reasons.

As the final float rounds the corner and our cleanup crews begin their work, we're reminded that fantasy football, like any good Thanksgiving parade, is about family, competition, and publicly humiliating your friends when they score 60 points in a week (looking at you, Aaron).

**This has been your Commissioner, signing off from the StatFink Fantasy Football Thanksgiving Day Parade Spectacular! See you next week, and may your balloons fly high and your floats never falter!**

*Confetti falls. Band plays. Somewhere, Eli quietly weeps.*
