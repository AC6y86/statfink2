# Week 9 Fantasy Football Recap: The Believe Edition
*Season 2025 - A Ted Lasso Joint*

---

## "Football is Life, But Fantasy Football... That's Like Life With Extra Sprinkles"

Well butter my biscuit and call me Richmond's favorite American export, what a week we just witnessed in our little fantasy football family! Week 9 of the 2025 season just wrapped up tighter than Rebecca's control over the biscuit supply, and let me tell you something - every single one of you beautiful people gave it your absolute best shot, and that's what this whole dang thing is about.

You know, back in Kansas, we had a saying: "Sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug, but either way, you're part of the journey." And boy howdy, did we see some journeys this week! From the highest of highs to the "learning opportunity" lows, every single matchup told a story worth telling. And you know what? I'm gonna tell every single one of 'em, because that's what we do here - we celebrate EVERYONE.

Before we dive into the beautiful chaos that was Week 9, I want you all to take a moment. Go ahead, close your eyes (well, maybe keep one open so you can keep reading). Picture yourself holding up a sign that just says "BELIEVE." Because whether you scored 128.5 points like our friend Chris or found yourself on the other end of the spectrum, the fact that you showed up, set your lineup, and gave it your all? That right there is worth more than all the fantasy points in the world. Well, maybe not ALL of them, but you get what I'm saying.

## The Crown Jewel: Chris's Magnificent 128.5-Point Masterpiece

Holy guacamole with a side of emotional vulnerability! Chris just put together what we in the coaching business call "a performance for the ages." With 128.5 net points after all the dust settled (and that sweet, sweet defensive bonus kicked in), Chris's Team didn't just win - they reminded us all why we fell in love with this beautiful game in the first place.

Now, I've seen a lot of things in my time - I've seen a grown man satisfy a camel (long story), I've seen Jamie Tartt pass when he could've scored, and I've even seen Beard smile once (I think). But what Chris accomplished this week? That was special, folks. Sam Darnold stepping up with 32 points like he just discovered what believing in yourself feels like, and Josh Allen adding another 30 points because, well, Josh Allen gonna Josh Allen. It's like watching a perfectly choreographed dance, except instead of dancers, it's quarterbacks throwing touchdowns, and instead of music, it's the sweet sound of fantasy points hitting your scoreboard.

But here's the thing that really gets me misty-eyed about Chris's performance - it wasn't just about the big names. No sir, this was a TEAM effort. Sure, they had 10 players score under 5 points, but you know what that tells me? That tells me Chris knew EXACTLY which horses to ride this week. It's like making Rebecca's biscuits - you don't need every ingredient to be fancy, you just need the right ones at the right time. And boy, did Chris pick the right ingredients this week!

## Matchup #1: Chris's Team (128.5) vs. Mike's Team (64.5) - "The Kindness in Victory"

**"Sometimes the Scoreboard Tells a Story, But It Ain't the Whole Book"**

Well folks, this matchup was what we call a "teaching moment" wrapped in a "learning experience" with a bow made of "tomorrow's another day." Chris came out swinging like Roy Kent after someone insulted his yoga practice, posting that massive 128.5 points we just talked about. Meanwhile, Mike... well, Mike learned what it's like to face a buzzsaw that's been sharpened by the football gods themselves.

Mike's 64.5 points might look rough on paper - and let's be honest, it IS rough on paper, on screen, and probably on Mike's heart right now - but here's what I saw: Tee Higgins still showed up with 27 points! That's not giving up, that's what we call "professional pride." Sure, Mike had 10 players score under 5 points, which is about as fun as Ted Lasso trying to understand the offside rule for the first three months in England (spoiler alert: I still don't fully get it). But you know what Mike did? Mike set a lineup. Mike competed. Mike didn't quit.

And here's the beautiful thing about fantasy football, something I learned from my good friend Beard (who's probably reading some obscure philosophy book about this very topic right now): Today's demolition is tomorrow's motivation. Mike's sitting at 790 total points for the season, which puts him in what I like to call the "room for improvement" zone. And you know what lives in that zone? Hope. Possibility. And probably a really good waiver wire pickup next week.

Chris, meanwhile, just vaulted into second place overall with 1,100 points on the season. That's not just good, that's "Rebecca finally admitting she likes the biscuits" good. But I know Chris, and I know Chris won't let this go to their head. Because true champions celebrate with grace, acknowledge their opponents with respect, and then get right back to work. That's the Richmond way... er, I mean, that's the fantasy football way!

## Matchup #2: Mitch's Team (91.5) vs. Aaron's Team (95.0) - "The Nail-Biter Special"

**"Three and a Half Points: A Novel About Hope, Heartbreak, and Healing"**

Sweet Christmas in July (even though it's November)! If this matchup was any closer, it would be violating social distancing guidelines! Aaron squeaked by Mitch by a mere 3.5 points, which in fantasy football terms is about as close as my relationship with tea when I first got to England - we were in the same room, but we weren't quite friends yet.

Aaron's team put up 95 points of pure "getting it done" energy. Jaxson Dart came through with 27 points like a young quarterback who just remembered he's got that dog in him. Sure, Aaron had 7 players underperform, and Zamir White was out there on the injury report looking sadder than Roy when Keeley makes him watch reality TV, but you know what? Aaron found a way. That's what champions do - they find a way.

Now Mitch, oh Mitch, my heart goes out to you like a perfectly delivered cross from Dani Rojas. 91.5 points is nothing to sneeze at - that's a solid effort! Lamar Jackson showed up with 26 points, and Michael Penix Jr. contributed 21 points like a backup dancer who suddenly gets a solo. But sometimes, just sometimes, the fantasy football gods decide to teach us about resilience through heartbreak. Mitch had FOUR players on the injury report - Brock Purdy, Cam Skattebo, Cooper Kupp, and Terry McLaurin all watching from the sidelines like assistant coaches who forgot their clipboards. That's not bad luck, that's character building!

What this matchup really shows us is that every point matters. Every decision counts. Every lineup choice is an opportunity to believe in something. Aaron's now at 741.5 points for the season, while Mitch sits at 721. They're both in what I call the "anything can happen" zone, which is my favorite zone because it's where miracles are born, dreams come true, and occasionally, someone accidentally starts a player on a bye week and still wins (hasn't happened yet this week, but there's always hope!).

## Matchup #3: Dan's Team (93.5) vs. Eli's Team (63.5) - "When Life Gives You Lemons, Sometimes It Forgets the Sugar"

**"A 30-Point Victory That Felt Like a Warm Hug on a Cold Day"**

You know what I love about Dan? Dan's consistent. Dan's steady. Dan's like that friend who always brings homemade cookies to the party - you know what you're getting, and it's always pretty darn good. This week, Dan put up 93.5 points and showed Eli what happens when Geno Smith (29 points) and Davante Adams (19 points) decide to show up to work with their lunch pails and hard hats on.

Dan had some adversity to overcome too - Hassan Haskins and Travis Hunter both on injured reserve, probably sharing stories about their glory days while icing various body parts. But that's the thing about Dan's team - they're resilient like a good barbecue sauce recipe that's been passed down through generations. Even with 10 players scoring under 5 points (which is about as helpful as a chocolate teapot), Dan found a way to put together a comprehensive victory.

Now Eli, sweet Eli. 63.5 points is what we in the business call "a learning experience sandwich with a side of character building." Not a single player scored over 15 points, which is like going to a buffet and finding out they're only serving celery. Joe Mixon being out definitely hurt, and Joshua Palmer joining him on the sideline made things tougher than trying to explain American football to my British friends (seriously, why ARE there so many commercial breaks?).

But here's what I want Eli to remember: You're at 737.5 points for the season. You're not out of anything yet! Fantasy football, like life, is a marathon, not a sprint. Actually, it's more like a marathon where sometimes you're running, sometimes you're crawling, and sometimes someone carries you, but everyone gets a medal at the end if they just keep showing up. Dan's sitting pretty at 798.5 points for the season, tied with Pete, which just goes to show - consistency might not always be sexy, but it sure does pay the bills!

---

## Matchup #4: Pete's Team (92.0) vs. Matt's Team (89.5) - "The Photo Finish That Nearly Broke the Camera"

**"Two and a Half Points: The Difference Between Joy and 'Well, Shoot'"**

Holy moly, guacamole, and every other exclamation I can think of! Pete edged Matt by 2.5 points in what can only be described as a battle tighter than my jeans after Thanksgiving dinner (which, fun fact, I celebrate twice now - once in America and once here, because why not?). This is the kind of matchup that makes you believe in the power of every single roster decision.

Pete came through with 92 points of pure grit and determination. Matthew Stafford proved why he's been in this league longer than some of our players have been alive, dropping 29 points like a seasoned veteran teaching the young pups how it's done. Sure, Pete had Brandon Aiyuk, Bucky Irving, D'Andre Swift, and Ricky Pearsall all sidelined like a boy band that's temporarily on hiatus, but Pete didn't let that stop the music! Even with only 2 players scoring above 15 points and 5 underperforming, Pete found a way to dance to victory.

Matt, oh Matt, this one's gonna sting like accidentally calling soccer "soccer" in a British pub. 89.5 points is a GOOD score! Christian McCaffrey showed he's still got that juice with 28 points, running like a man who just remembered he left the oven on at home. Matt had 3 players score above 15 points, which is more than Pete! But A.J. Brown and Isiah Pacheco watching from the injury list probably didn't help matters. It's like trying to make Rebecca's biscuits without flour - you can try your best with what you've got, but something important is missing.

Both these fellas are sitting at interesting spots in the standings - Pete at 798.5 points (tied with Dan!) and Matt at 820.5 points for the season. That's what we call "middle of the pack with room to attack!" They're both very much in the playoff hunt, and this 2.5-point difference might matter come playoff seeding time. But for now, Pete gets the W, Matt gets the learning experience, and we all get to appreciate just how beautiful a close game can be!

---

## Matchup #5: Joe's Team (107.5) vs. Cal's Team (125.5) - "The Heavyweight Title Fight"

**"When Titans Clash, We All Win (Except Joe, Who Technically Lost)"**

Now THIS is what I'm talking about! When the fifth and fourth-place teams throw down, you know you're gonna see some fireworks, and boy howdy, did we get a Fourth of July spectacular in November! Cal came out on top with 125.5 points, while Joe put up a more-than-respectable 107.5 points. These weren't just good scores; these were "make the highlight reel" scores!

Cal's performance was like watching a master chef work their magic in the kitchen - every ingredient perfectly placed, every flavor balanced just right. Caleb Williams lived up to his name with 35 glorious points, playing quarterback like he just discovered the secret to life, the universe, and everything (spoiler: it's not 42, it's throwing touchdowns). Drake London added 33 points because apparently Cal decided regular winning wasn't enough - Cal wanted to win with STYLE. And Trevor Lawrence chipped in 22 points like the reliable friend who always helps you move. Sure, Cal had 10 players underperform, but when your stars shine this bright, sometimes that's all you need!

Joe, sweet Joe, sitting pretty at the top of the overall standings with 1,116.5 total points, put up 107.5 points this week and STILL lost. That's like making a perfect cup of tea and then dropping it - everything was right, but the universe had other plans. Jacoby Brissett came through with 27 points like an unexpected gift from a distant relative, and Rico Dowdle added 25 points, proving that sometimes the best performances come from the most unexpected places. Joe had FOUR players score above 15 points - that's balance, that's depth, that's the kind of team construction that wins championships!

This matchup shows us something beautiful about our league - when two good teams go head-to-head, we all win. Cal moves to 919 total points, firmly in fourth place and looking dangerous. Joe remains our overall leader despite the loss, because that's what great teams do - they accumulate points even in defeat. It's like losing a battle but winning the war, except nobody actually gets hurt and we all go home to our families afterward!

## Matchup #6: Bruce's Team (112.5) vs. Sean's Team (112.0) - "The Half-Point Heartbreaker"

**"Sometimes Victory is Measured in Decimals and Heartbeats"**

STOP THE PRESSES! ALERT THE MEDIA! SOMEBODY CHECK THE MATH AGAIN! Bruce beat Sean by HALF A POINT! 0.5 points! That's less than a point! That's like winning a race by an eyelash, except the eyelash is invisible and made of fantasy football points! This is the kind of finish that makes you believe in destiny, fate, and the importance of decimal places!

Bruce's 112.5-point performance was a thing of beauty mixed with chaos. Brock Bowers decided to have himself a DAY with 33 points, tight-ending (is that a verb? It is now!) his way to glory like he just discovered he had superpowers. Daniel Jones contributed 25 points because apparently playing for the Giants in fantasy is different from playing for the Giants in reality. Drake Maye added 19 points off the bench like the sixth man who becomes the hero. Bruce had 3 players score above 15, but also had 8 underperformers, which just goes to show - sometimes you don't need perfection, you just need half a point more than the other guy!

Sean, oh Sean, my heart breaks for you like a graham cracker that's been left out in the humidity! 112 points is a GREAT score! Joe Flacco turned back the clock with 37 points, playing quarterback like it was 2012 and he just won the Super Bowl again. Justin Herbert added 30 points because he's Justin Herbert and that's what Justin Herbert does. But Garrett Wilson and Rhamondre Stevenson being out hurt more than stepping on a LEGO in the dark. Sean had everything except that final half point, which in fantasy football is like having everything except the winning lottery number.

Bruce now sits at 939.5 points for the season, good for third place overall. Sean's at 862 points, holding steady in fifth. Both are in prime playoff position, and this half-point victory might be the difference between a first-round bye and a wild card spot. But more importantly, this game reminded us all why we check our scores seventeen times every Sunday and why we argue about decimal scoring. Every. Point. Matters!

## The Performance Tier Analysis: "Sorting the Wheat from the Chaff from the 'We'll Get 'Em Next Week'"

**The Elite Tier (125+ points): "The Penthouse Suite"**

Only two teams made it to the promised land this week - Chris with that magnificent 128.5 and Cal with a stellar 125.5. These folks aren't just playing fantasy football; they're conducting a symphony where every note is a touchdown and every rest is a strategically benched player. These are the teams that make you check your lineup and wonder, "What do they know that I don't?" The answer? This week, apparently everything!

**The Competitive Tier (100-124 points): "The Folks Doing Just Fine, Thank You Very Much"**

Bruce (112.5), Sean (112.0), and Joe (107.5) all landed in this sweet spot where you're scoring enough to beat most teams but maybe not enough to beat Cal or Chris when they're firing on all cylinders. This is like being really good at karaoke - you're definitely impressing people, you might even win some contests, but you're probably not getting a record deal. Still, these scores win a lot of weeks, and that's what matters!

**The "We Tried Our Best" Tier (85-99 points): "The Participation Trophy Recipients"**

Aaron (95.0), Dan (93.5), Pete (92.0), Mitch (91.5), and Matt (89.5) all landed here, and you know what? There's no shame in this game! These scores are like a good honest day's work - you showed up, you put in effort, you went home with dignity intact. Sure, you might not have won, but you scored more points than a soccer game (football to my British friends), and that's something!

**The "Learning Experience" Tier (Below 85): "Tomorrow's Another Day"**

Mike (64.5) and Eli (63.5) are having what we call a "character-building week." These scores are like accidentally wearing your shirt inside out all day - it happens to everyone eventually, it's embarrassing in the moment, but tomorrow you'll check your shirt AND your lineup more carefully!

## The Bust Brigade: "When Good Players Go Bad"

This week's "Thanks for Nothing" award goes to several supposed studs who decided Week 9 was a good time for a nap. We're not naming names (yes we are), but certain players who shall remain nameless (they won't) really let their fantasy owners down. 

The entire injury list this week read like a who's who of "players you really needed to score points" - Brock Purdy, Cooper Kupp, Terry McLaurin, A.J. Brown, Brandon Aiyuk, Garrett Wilson - it's like they all got together and decided to throw a "Let's Disappoint Our Fantasy Owners" party, and everyone RSVP'd yes!

But here's the thing about busts - they're just future bounce-back candidates! Every player who disappointed this week is just storing up fantasy points for next week, like a squirrel storing nuts for winter, except the nuts are touchdowns and the winter is Week 10!

---

## Close Calls & Heartbreaks: "When Every Point Counts"

Can we just take a moment of silence for Sean, who lost by HALF A POINT? That's like losing a coin flip when the coin lands on its edge. That's like finishing second in a race where first and second place are determined by photo finish and you forgot to smile. 

And how about Matt, losing by 2.5 points to Pete? That's the kind of loss that makes you replay every lineup decision in your head at 3 AM. "What if I'd started this guy instead of that guy?" "What if I'd picked up that waiver wire player?" "What if I'd just believed a little harder?"

But here's what Coach Lasso wants you to remember: These close losses build character. They make the victories sweeter. They're the reason we keep coming back, keep setting lineups, keep believing that next week will be our week!

---

## Looking Ahead: "The Road to Glory is Paved with Optimism"

As we head into the final stretch of the regular season, Joe's Team continues to lead the way with 1,116.5 points, but Chris is hot on those heels with 1,100 points. That's closer than me and an understanding of the offside rule! The playoff race is tighter than Roy Kent's control over his emotions, and that's saying something!

The bottom of the standings might look dire for some, but remember - fantasy football, like life, is about the journey, not just the destination. Mitch at 721 points and Eli at 737.5 aren't out of it yet! There's still time for miraculous comebacks, waiver wire gems, and that beautiful moment when everything clicks!

The injury report is longer than one of Beard's book recommendations, but injuries heal, players return, and hope springs eternal. Next week is a new opportunity for everyone to prove that this week was just a warm-up, a practice run, a dress rehearsal for the real show!

## The Final Whistle: "Believe"

Well folks, that's Week 9 in the books, and what a week it was! We laughed (at the scores), we cried (also at the scores), and we learned that half a point can be the difference between victory and "wait, let me check that math again."

Remember, this league isn't just about winning and losing - it's about showing up, trying your best, and believing that next week will be better. It's about the friendships we've made, the trash talk we've shared, and the collective groan we all make when someone's defense scores negative points.

To Chris and Cal - congratulations on your big weeks! Wear those high scores like a badge of honor, but remember, with great power comes great responsibility to not be a jerk about it.

To Mike and Eli - your time will come. Every dog has its day, every player has their breakout game, and every fantasy owner eventually gets to experience the joy of destroying their opponent. Hold onto that hope like I hold onto my belief in the power of positivity!

To everyone else - you're all beautiful, wonderful, capable fantasy football managers who are just one waiver wire pickup away from greatness. Keep believing, keep setting those lineups, and keep being the amazing community that makes this league special.

And remember, as I always say: "Fantasy Football is life!" But also, it's just a game, so don't let it ruin your actual life. Unless you lost by half a point. Then maybe be sad for like an hour. That's fair.

Until next week, this is your eternal optimist, your minister of morale, your beacon of believing, reminding you that whether you scored 128.5 or 63.5, you're all champions in my book. And my book is full of butterscotch candies and good intentions!

BELIEVE!

*P.S. - Roy wanted me to tell you all something but it contained too many expletives, so instead he just wants you to know he cares about you all very much in his own special way. Jamie wanted me to mention he would have scored 200 points if he played fantasy football. And Beard... Well, Beard just nodded, which from him is basically a standing ovation.*

*P.P.S - Rebecca says the biscuits are ready if anyone wants to come by. They pair wonderfully with victory or defeat. Mostly victory, but defeat too.*
