# WEEK 11: "OH MY GOD, THEY KILLED AARON'S SEASON!" 
## A South Park Fantasy Football Extravaganza

### *"You Bastards!"*

**FADE IN: INT. STAN'S BASEMENT - NIGHT**

*The boys sit around checking their fantasy scores on their phones. Cartman is eating KFC while sobbing.*

**CARTMAN:** "Screw you guys, I'm going home! This is total bullshit! How the hell does Chris score 155 points while my stupid team—I mean Aaron's team—scores 60?! SIXTY GODDAMN POINTS! That's not even enough points to buy tendies at KFC! This is worse than the time Kyle's mom grounded him for a month!"

**KYLE:** "Shut up fatass, at least Aaron HAS a team. You're just mad because your mom won't let you join the league after what you did last year with the 'performance enhancing Mountain Dew' scandal."

**STAN:** "Dude, did you guys see what happened this week? It's like watching those adults who dress up as furries at conventions, except somehow MORE embarrassing. These grown-ass men are literally crying over imaginary football points."

**KENNY:** *(muffled)* "Mmph mmph mmph Chris mmph Josh Allen mmph 48 points!"

**STAN:** "Yeah Kenny, Josh Allen went completely Tegridy Farms on everyone's ass this week."

## THE MASSACRE AT FANTASY FOOTBALL ELEMENTARY

### **Episode 11x25: "Chris's Team Goes Full Randy Marsh"**

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and whatever the hell Butters identifies as these days, welcome to another absolutely batshit insane week of fantasy football where grown men act like bigger babies than Ike Broflovski at a candy store. This week's episode features more carnage than a Terrance and Phillip marathon, more tears than Kyle at his Bar Mitzvah, and more complete annihilation than when Cartman got his revenge on Scott Tenorman.

Let me paint you a picture, m'kay? Picture twelve grown-ass adults, sitting in their underwear on Sunday morning, refreshing their phones every three seconds like crack addicts waiting for their dealer—except their dealer is the ESPN fantasy app, and their crack is watching meaningless numbers go up and down. It's pathetic. It's sad. It's... it's fucking BEAUTIFUL in its absolute stupidity!

This week, we witnessed something so disturbing, so completely one-sided, that even Satan himself called from Hell to say, "Jesus Christ, maybe tone it down a bit?" But no, Chris's Team wasn't having any of that Canadian politeness bullshit. They came in like Randy Marsh on a cocaine bender at a Little League game and absolutely DESTROYED everything in their path.

## **THE HEADLINER: CHRIS'S TEAM - "RESPECT MY AUTHORITAH!"**

Holy shit balls, you guys! Chris's Team didn't just win this week—they went full Eric Cartman feeding Scott Tenorman his parents in chili form. With a devastating 155 net points (after defensive bonuses, because we're not complete morons who forget about defense like Kyle forgets to eat bacon), Chris established himself as the undisputed "I Have No Life" champion of Week 11.

Let's talk about Josh Allen putting up 48 fucking points like he's been mainlining Butters' Creamy Goo energy drink. FORTY-EIGHT POINTS! That's more points than the number of times Cartman has called Kyle a "stupid Jew" in a single episode! Allen was throwing touchdowns like Chef was throwing down sick beats before he joined that fruity little club. The man was unstoppable, untouchable, un-fucking-believable! He made defenses look like the entire town of South Park trying to understand cryptocurrency—completely lost and crying for their mommies.

But wait, there's more! *(in best Billy Mays voice, may he rest in peace unlike Kenny who dies every week)* Dak Prescott decided to show up with 29 points like Stan's dad after three glasses of wine at a school play—surprisingly competent and oddly entertaining. And TreVeyon Henderson? That beautiful bastard rushed for 27 points faster than Cartman runs to the front of the lunch line. Even Jameson Williams managed 14 points, which is approximately 14 more points than anyone expected from a guy named Jameson who isn't a whiskey bottle.

Chris is now sitting pretty at 9-2, accumulating 1,409 total points on the season like he's collecting Chinpokomon cards. "I got to buy them all!" Well guess what? Chris basically DID buy them all, and now everyone else is stuck with their stupid Shoe and Pengin while he's sitting there with his Wild Wacky Action Bike and dominating the league like a boss.

## **THE BLOODBATH MATCHUPS: "Now This Is What I Call Music... To Kill Yourself To!"**

### **MATCHUP 1: Chris's Team (155) vs. Eli's Team (79) - "The Passion of the Eli"**

**"Oh Hamburgers!"** - Butters, and also probably Eli after this matchup

Picture this: Eli woke up Sunday morning, probably made himself a nice cup of coffee, checked his lineup one more time, and thought, "You know what? Today might be my day!" WRONG! WRONG, YOU NAIVE LITTLE LEOPOLD! Chris's team came in like Mr. Garrison's "IT" vehicle and absolutely violated every hole of dignity Eli had left.

Eli's squad scored 79 pathetic points, which coincidentally is the same number of times per episode that Randy says "Sharon" in that disappointed voice. Patrick Mahomes, supposedly an elite quarterback, managed only 14 points—that's fewer points than the number of times Cartman has genuinely been nice to someone (which is approximately 15, and 14 of those were to get something in return). Kenneth Gainwell tried his best with 22 points, running around like Tweek on his eighth cup of coffee, but it wasn't nearly enough.

The real tragedy? Eli had more players injured than the casualties from the Great Canada-America War. Joe Mixon? Out. C.J. Stroud? Out. Amon-Ra St. Brown? Zero points, might as well have been out. David Montgomery? Also zero, probably too busy thinking about why his parents named him David instead of something cool like Thunderhawk or Kyle's Mom Is A Bitch. This wasn't just a loss—this was like watching Pip get crushed by Mecha-Streisand all over again. Nobody really cared about Pip, but damn, it was still brutal to watch.

The 76-point margin of defeat is larger than Cartman's ass after a KFC binge, and that's saying something. Eli is now 5-6, sitting in fantasy purgatory—not quite dead, but definitely not making the playoffs unless some kind of miracle happens. And we all know the only miracles in South Park involve either Jesus or that time Stan's grandpa didn't die for a whole episode.

### **MATCHUP 2: Mitch's Team (93) vs. Sean's Team (76) - "The Hardly Boys Mystery: The Case of the Missing Points"**

**"I've got such a raging clue right now!"** - The Hardly Boys, trying to figure out where Sean's points went

In what can only be described as the fantasy football equivalent of two cripples fighting over the last wheelchair at the Special Olympics (yes, we went there, this is South Park, deal with it), Mitch somehow managed to beat Sean 93-76. This was like watching Jimmy and Timmy race—technically someone won, but Jesus Christ, was it painful to watch.

Brock Purdy led Mitch's charge with 21 points, which is impressive for a guy whose name sounds like something Cartman would call Kyle when he's trying not to get in trouble with PC Principal. "What? I called him Brock Purdy! That's his name!" George Kittle contributed 19 points, tight-ending his way through Sean's defense like Mr. Mackey through a bag of marijuana brownies—confused but surprisingly effective.

But here's where it gets sad, m'kay? Mitch had FIVE players score absolute donuts. ZERO. ZILCH. NADA. Chuba Hubbard, Brian Robinson Jr., Cooper Kupp, Michael Penix Jr., and Terry McLaurin all decided to take the week off like Kenny's parents at a job interview. That's literally over a quarter of his team just not showing up! It's like if the boys tried to start a band but Kyle refused to play bass because it's "too mainstream."

Sean, meanwhile, proved once again that having a 3-8 record isn't just bad luck—it's a lifestyle choice. Travis Etienne Jr. tried with 19 points, Devin Singletary added 16, but when your quarterback situation involves starting Cam Ward (11 points) and Joe Flacco (11 points), you're basically admitting defeat before the games even start. That's like bringing a dreidel to a gun fight—sure, it's something, but you're still going to fucking die.

Sean had Justin Herbert score zero points, because apparently even elite quarterbacks want nothing to do with this dumpster fire of a roster. His 1,032 total points on the season is respectable, but when you're 3-8, nobody cares about your point total. It's like bragging about having the biggest penis in the morgue—technically impressive, but you're still dead.

### **MATCHUP 3: Dan's Team (98) vs. Cal's Team (109.5) - "Bigger, Longer, and Uncut (But Still a Loss)"**

**"Waaaah! Waaaah! Dan's a little crybaby!"** - Cartman, probably

This matchup was closer than Kyle and Ike's relationship, but ultimately Cal pulled out the victory 109.5 to 98, leaving Dan crying harder than Butters after getting grounded for the 47th time this month.

Cal's team was carried by Bijan Robinson's 25 points, running through Dan's defense like Lemmiwinks through Mr. Slave's digestive system—it was gross, it was unexpected, but somehow it was also majestic. Trevor Lawrence added 13 points, which for Trevor Lawrence in 2025 is basically like watching Randy finally stay sober for an entire episode—shocking and worth celebrating. But the real tragedy here is that Cal had SEVEN players score absolute zeros. SEVEN! That's more zeros than the number of times Stan has successfully talked to Wendy without vomiting!

Dan's team put up a respectable fight with Kyren Williams (14 points), Kenneth Walker III (11 points), and Geno Smith (11 points) all contributing like they're the B-team at a middle school dance—trying their best but nobody's really impressed. The problem is that Dan also had multiple zeros, including Blake Corum and Khalil Shakir, who apparently decided that playing fantasy football was too mainstream this week.

At 4-7, Dan is basically the Pip of this fantasy league—technically still here, nobody really hates him, but also nobody would notice if he just disappeared one day. Cal, at 6-5, is still in the playoff hunt, clinging to hope like Tweek clings to coffee—desperately and with a lot of unnecessary screaming.

### **MATCHUP 4: Pete's Team (98) vs. Aaron's Team (60) - "Dead Kids Don't Score Fantasy Points"**

**"Screw you guys, I'm going home!"** - Aaron, after seeing his score

Ladies and gentlemen, what we witnessed here wasn't a matchup—it was a war crime. Aaron's team scoring 60 points is like watching Butters try to be a pimp—you know it's going to end badly, but you can't look away from the train wreck.

Pete's team was led by Sean Tucker exploding for 33 points like Kenny after eating Cartman's "special" chili. Jared Goff, Travis Kelce, and Nico Collins each added 14 points, which is solid, consistent production—kind of like how Token is consistently the only black kid in South Park. It's not particularly exciting, but it's reliable.

But Aaron... oh, Aaron. Sweet, naive, probably-should-have-just-forfeited Aaron. This man had Jayden Daniels (Out), Kyler Murray (Injured Reserve), and Marvin Harrison Jr. (Out) all deciding that existence is pain and they'd rather not participate. When your only bright spot is Tetairoa McMillan with 25 points, you know you're in deeper shit than Mr. Hankey after Taco Tuesday.

Sixty points. SIXTY! That's fewer points than the IQ of the average South Park adult, and those people literally elected a giant douche as their school mascot! Aaron is now 2-9, which statistically makes him more likely to get struck by lightning than make the playoffs. His 875.5 total points is dead last in the league, making him the official "Kenny" of this fantasy league—constantly dying and nobody really giving a shit anymore.

Pete, now 6-5, is somehow still in the playoff race despite having Brandon Aiyuk and Sam LaPorta both on injured reserve. It's like succeeding despite having Randy as your father—theoretically impossible, but somehow Randy's kids turned out okay-ish.

### **MATCHUP 5: Joe's Team (91) vs. Mike's Team (65.5) - "Mike's Mom Is A Big Fat Bitch" (She's Not, But His Team Sure Is)**

**"Wellllll, Mike's team is dumb, Mike's team is lame, Mike's team scored sixty-five and that's a shame!"**

Joe crushed Mike 91 to 65.5 in what can only be described as beating up the kid with asthma at recess—yeah, you won, but did you really accomplish anything meaningful?

Joe's team was led by Jacoby Brissett somehow scoring 25 points, which is like watching Butters successfully ground his parents—nobody saw it coming but damn if it wasn't effective. George Pickens added 17, Justin Fields contributed 16, and James Cook III chipped in 11. It wasn't pretty, it wasn't spectacular, but it got the job done like Stan's relationship with Wendy—functional but lacking passion.

Mike, on the other hand, scored 65.5 points, which is approximately how many brain cells are left in Randy's head after all his "Tegridy" testing. Baker Mayfield managed 13 points, Jordan Love added 12, and Tee Higgins contributed 11, but when your running back Emari Demercado is out and you're starting Jacory Croskey-Merritt who scored ZERO points, you're basically admitting you've given up on life like Stan in that episode where he saw everything as shit.

At 4-7, Mike is trapped in fantasy football hell—not quite dead enough to stop caring, but definitely not alive enough to matter. Joe, meanwhile, sits pretty at 9-2 with 1,341.5 total points, second only to Chris in the standings. He's like Kyle in the group—annoyingly successful but you can't really hate him for it because he's actually trying.

### **MATCHUP 6: Bruce's Team (67.5) vs. Matt's Team (94) - "I'm Not Fat, I'm Big-Boned! (Bruce's Team Is Just Bad)"**

**"How do I reach these kids?"** - Mr. Mackey, trying to explain to Bruce why his team sucks

Matt destroyed Bruce 94 to 67.5 in what was essentially the fantasy football equivalent of Cartman's "Casa Bonita" manipulation of Butters—cruel, calculated, and completely one-sided.

Matt was powered by Bryce Young's shocking 32 points, proving that even backup quarterbacks can have their day in the sun, like that time Butters became a pimp and was actually successful for about five minutes. Christian McCaffrey added 30 points because he's Christian McCaffrey and that's just what he does—score points with the reliability of Kenny dying. Derrick Henry contributed 17 points, running through Bruce's hopes and dreams like Randy through a case of beer at Stan's little league game.

Bruce's team, meanwhile, scored 67.5 points, which is sadder than the time Chef left to join the Super Adventure Club. Drake Maye tried with 14 points, Bhayshul Tuten added 11, but when Calvin Ridley is on injured reserve and your team is literally falling apart, you're basically the Washington Redskins of fantasy football—offensive to watch and definitely going nowhere.

Bruce is now 6-5, still technically in the playoff hunt but realistically about as likely to win the championship as Cartman is to go on a diet. Matt, at 7-4, has quietly put together a solid season with 964 total points, like Craig—nobody really talks about him much, but he's always there, flipping everyone off and doing his thing.

## **PERFORMANCE TIER ANALYSIS: "The List" (But For Fantasy, And Nobody Gets Shot)**

### **The Elite Tier: "Respect My Authoritah!"**
- **Chris's Team (155 points)**: The Cartman of Week 11—fat, happy, and crushing everyone's dreams

### **The Mediocre Middle School Tier: "I'm Not Your Friend, Buddy!"**
- **Cal's Team (109.5)**: Like Tweek—surprisingly functional despite obvious issues
- **Dan's Team (98)**: The Clyde of fantasy—present but forgettable  
- **Pete's Team (98)**: Token effort (pun intended)
- **Matt's Team (94)**: Solid like Chef's chocolate salty balls
- **Mitch's Team (93)**: Barely breathing, like Kenny after most episodes
- **Joe's Team (91)**: Kyle energy—smart enough to win ugly

### **The Special Olympics Tier: "TIMMAH!"**
- **Eli's Team (79)**: GOBBLES!
- **Sean's Team (76)**: Limited vocabulary of fantasy success
- **Bruce's Team (67.5)**: JIMMY! (But slower)
- **Mike's Team (65.5)**: Basically the Nathan of this league
- **Aaron's Team (60)**: MIMSY! (And just as functional)

The gap between Chris's 155 and Aaron's 60 is 95 points—that's larger than the gap between PC Principal's muscles and realistic body proportions. It's astronomical. It's embarrassing. It's... it's fucking hilarious is what it is!

## **THE BUST BRIGADE: "Oh My God, They Killed Value! You Bastards!"**

This week's lineup of players who scored zero points is longer than the line at Casa Bonita when Cartman faked a meteor strike. We're talking about supposed "starters" who contributed less to their teams than Pip contributed to the show before he was crushed by Mecha-Streisand.

**The Hall of Shame:**
- **Amon-Ra St. Brown** (Eli): Supposed stud, actual dud
- **David Montgomery** (Eli): More like David Montgom-zero
- **Cooper Kupp** (Mitch): Cup half empty? Try cup completely fucking empty
- **Justin Herbert** (Sean): Herbie fully loaded... with disappointment
- **Ashton Jeanty, Emeka Egbuka, Dylan Sampson** (Cal): The Three Stooges of fantasy failure
- **Josh Jacobs, Tony Pollard** (Chris): Even the winner had some stinkers

These players didn't just underperform—they straight-up didn't perform. It's like they all collectively decided to protest fantasy football like the boys protested Canada in the movie. "Blame Canada!" Well, this week we're blaming these lazy bastards who couldn't even accidentally score a single point.

---

## **CLOSE CALLS & HEARTBREAKS: "I'm Super, Thanks For Asking!"**

The closest matchup this week was Cal defeating Dan by 11.5 points, which in fantasy terms is like winning a fight with Timmy—yeah, you won, but was it really that close? Or that impressive?

Bruce losing by 26.5 points thought he had a chance until Matt's team decided to go Super Saiyan in the fourth quarter. It's like when Butters thought he had a chance with the Raisins girl—adorable optimism crushed by harsh reality.

Mitch beating Sean by 17 points was about as close as these bottom-feeders could get to competitive football. It's like watching two kids with asthma race—someone has to win, but nobody's breaking any records.

---

## **INJURY REPORT: "We Need To Talk About Kenny... And Everyone Else Who Died"**

**"OH MY GOD, THEY KILLED [INSERT PLAYER NAME]!"**

This week's injury list reads like the guest list at Kenny's funeral—extensive and nobody's really surprised anymore:

### **The Walking Dead (Out for Week):**
- **Jayden Daniels** (Aaron): Commanders' QB said "Screw you guys, I'm going home"
- **Marvin Harrison Jr.** (Aaron): Appendix exploded like Kenny. He'll be back though... probably
- **Joe Mixon** (Eli): Foot/ankle combo, out until 2025 apparently. That's longer than Chef's adventure with the Super Adventure Club!
- **C.J. Stroud** (Matt): Concussion protocol, or as we call it in South Park, "got Tegridy'd"
- **Terry McLaurin** (Mitch): Just... out. No explanation. Like Chef's sudden departure

### **The Permanently Deceased (Injured Reserve):**
- **Kyler Murray** (Aaron): Mid-foot sprain, won't start again even if he returns. Basically fantasy football's version of Chef after the Super Adventure Club got him
- **Calvin Ridley** (Bruce): Fibula injury, placed on IR faster than you can say "Oh hamburgers!"
- **Michael Penix Jr.** (Mitch): Partially torn ACL, needs full reconstruction. That's more reconstruction than Kenny needs after most episodes
- **Brandon Aiyuk** (Pete): Still week-to-week, which in NFL terms means "definitely not coming back but we don't want to admit it"
- **Sam LaPorta** (Pete): Back injury, IR'd like he got hit by the Batmobile
- **Cam Skattebo** (Mitch): Ankle injury since October. He's been dead longer than anyone realized, like Pip in later seasons

---

## **LOOKING AHEAD: "I Learned Something Today..." (No You Didn't)**

As we stumble drunk and confused into Week 12 like Randy at a PTA meeting, let's look at what this all means for the playoff race, m'kay?

**Chris and Joe (both 9-2)** are basically locked for the playoffs unless they collectively decide to channel their inner Randy and completely shit the bed for the rest of the season. Chris has been more dominant than Cartman at an all-you-can-eat buffet, while Joe has been quietly effective like Kyle when he's not being a preachy little bitch about something.

**Matt (7-4)** is sitting pretty in third place, accumulating wins like Randy accumulates DUIs—steadily and without much fanfare. He's basically guaranteed a playoff spot unless something catastrophic happens, like his entire team getting cancer from Randy's medicinal marijuana.

**The Middle School Dance Awkward Zone (all 6-5):**
- **Cal**: Has the points but needs to stop starting injured players
- **Bruce**: Hanging on like Tweek to his coffee mug
- **Pete**: Somehow still alive despite the injuries

These three are basically in a Mexican standoff, except they're all too incompetent to actually shoot each other. One of them will probably make the playoffs, but it'll be uglier than Mr. Mackey without his tie.

**The "Why Are We Still Here?" Brigade:**
- **Eli and Mitch (5-6)**: Mathematical chance? Yes. Realistic chance? About as likely as Cartman admitting he's fat
- **Dan and Mike (4-7)**: Need a miracle bigger than the time Jesus helped the boys win at ice hockey
- **Sean (3-8)**: Might as well start planning for next year
- **Aaron (2-9)**: Dead. So dead. Deader than Kenny. At least Kenny comes back

The playoff race is tighter than Cartman's pants after Thanksgiving, and with only a few weeks left, every matchup matters. Unless you're Aaron. Nothing matters for Aaron anymore. His season is over. His dreams are dead. His team is basically the Terrance and Phillip Show—Canadian and completely irrelevant to anything important.

---

## **FINAL THOUGHTS: "Screw You Guys, I'm Going Home!"**

Week 11 of the 2025 fantasy football season was like a typical South Park episode—vulgar, violent, and somebody definitely got fucked. Chris established dominance like Cartman establishing his authori-tah, while Aaron's team died harder than Kenny in a particularly creative death scene.

We witnessed grown men cry over imaginary points, watched supposed "studs" score fewer points than the number of times Butters has been grounded this season (which is zero points, by the way), and saw injury lists longer than the menu at City Wok. It was beautiful. It was tragic. It was fantasy football.

As we head into the final weeks of the regular season, remember: Fantasy football is like living in South Park—it makes no fucking sense, somebody's always getting screwed, and despite all logic and reason, we keep coming back for more. Because we're idiots. Complete and total idiots obsessing over a children's game played by millionaires who don't give a shit about our fantasy teams.

But hey, at least we're not Aaron. That poor bastard scored 60 points. SIXTY! That's not even enough points to buy respect in prison. That's not even enough points to matter. That's just... sad.

So until next week, when we'll undoubtedly witness more grown men acting like bigger babies than Ike, more injuries than a Canadian royal wedding, and more disappointment than Kyle finding out Cartman was right about something, this has been your South Park Fantasy Football Recap.

**"BYE KIDS!"** *- Chef's ghost, and also this recap*

*[END SCENE: The boys walk away as Kenny gets killed by a rogue fantasy football projection. "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!" "You bastards!" Nobody seems particularly upset.]*

---

**RATING:** TV-MA for Mature Audiences (Contains adult language, fantasy football violence, and statistics that may be disturbing to Aaron)

**RUNTIME:** Longer than it takes Cartman to eat a bucket of KFC (approximately 4 minutes)

**PRODUCTION:** Tegridy Farms presents a Randy Marsh joint (pun intended)

*"Come on down to South Park and meet some friends of mine!"* (They're all losing at fantasy football)
