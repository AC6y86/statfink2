# Week 7: A Sit-Down With The Don
## The Family Business Report - 2025 Season

*The heavy oak doors to the Don's study creak open. Smoke from Cuban cigars hangs thick in the air like morning fog over the East River. You've been summoned. The Don sits behind his mahogany desk, fingers steepled, eyes dark and knowing. He gestures to the chair across from him. You sit. The leather creaks. Outside, you can hear the distant sound of church bells - or maybe that's just your conscience ringing. Either way, it's time for the weekly accounting of the famiglia's business...*

"Come, sit. We have much to discuss about this week's... enterprises. Some of our people, they've shown great respect. Others..." *The Don pauses, swirling amber liquid in a crystal glass* "...others have disappointed the family. In this thing of ours, you're either at the table or you're on the menu. Capisce?"

## The Capo di Tutti Capi: Mike's Crew Sends a Message (134.0 Points)

*The Don's eyes gleam with approval as he slides a folder across the desk.*

"Now THIS is how you handle business. Mike, he understands respect. His crew put up 134 points - the kind of numbers that make the other families take notice. That Jahmyr Gibbs, he's a real earner - 31 points, running through defenses like they owed him money. Beautiful thing to watch, like poetry in motion, if poetry involved crushing your enemies into dust."

"And this Quinshon Judkins kid - another 30 points. Mike's got himself a regular murder's row here. Two running backs combining for 61 points? That's not luck, that's planning. That's what we call strategic thinking in this business. The kind of thinking that keeps you alive in this game."

"Sure, he had some dead weight - that Alvin Kamara, Mike Evans, they didn't show up for work this week. Zero points each. In the old days, we'd have sent them a message they wouldn't forget. But Mike's other soldiers picked up the slack. That's what a good capo does - he plans for contingencies. Even when some of his best men are taking a dirt nap, he still comes out on top."

*The Don leans back, a rare smile crossing his weathered face.*

"134 points against Cal's measly 85? That wasn't a matchup, that was an execution. Public. Brutal. The kind that sends a message to the whole neighborhood. Mike's crew, they're made men now. Untouchable."

## The Collection Business: Every Debt Gets Paid

### Chris's Crew vs. Dan's Organization (128.5 to 116.5)

*The Don's fingers drum on the desk as he reviews the next file.*

"Chris, now there's a man who understands the importance of maintaining order. Six wins, one loss - that's championship blood running through his veins. This week, he collected 128.5 points, enough to keep Dan's crew at bay."

"That Dak Prescott, he's Chris's triggerman - 24 points, precise as a stiletto between the ribs. And Josh Jacobs with 19? That's what we call reliable muscle. Not flashy, but gets the job done every time. When you need someone to break kneecaps, you call guys like Jacobs."

"Dan, he tried to make a move. I respect that. His crew put up 116.5 - respectable numbers in any other week. That Jalen Hurts, 27 points, he's got heart. Aaron Rodgers with 26, still showing he's got bullets left in the chamber. And Davante Adams bringing in 24? That's a three-headed monster that would make most crews wet their pants."

"But here's the thing about this business - almost don't feed the family. Dan's sitting at 3-4 now, watching his playoff hopes slip away like sand through his fingers. In this game, you're either the hammer or the nail. This week, Dan was the nail."

*The Don takes a long sip from his glass.*

"The beautiful part? Chris didn't even need his heavy hitters. TreVeyon Henderson, Tony Pollard, Jameson Williams - all zeroes. That's like winning a gang war with half your soldiers on vacation. That's power. That's respect."

### Bruce's Brigade Makes Aaron An Offer He Couldn't Refuse (118.0 to 96.5)

*A slight chuckle escapes the Don's lips as he opens the next folder.*

"Bruce, he's what we call a problem solver. When Aaron came knocking, Bruce's crew answered with extreme prejudice - 118 points worth of pain."

"You want to know about earning? Bo Nix - THIRTY-NINE POINTS. That's not a performance, that's a statement. That's walking into enemy territory and burning down their whole operation. When a quarterback puts up numbers like that, it's like having a tommy gun at a knife fight."

"And Bruce, he's smart. He's got depth. Daniel Jones with 21, Ja'Marr Chase with 20, Drake Maye adding 19. That's what we call diversified investments. When you spread the wealth around, nobody can take you down with one shot."

"Aaron's crew, they tried. God knows they tried. That Jaxson Dart kid showed heart - 32 points, fighting like a cornered rat. But when your capo's putting up zeroes - Jakobi Meyers, Kyler Murray both MIA - you're fighting with one hand tied behind your back."

*The Don shakes his head slowly.*

"Aaron's 0-7 now. In the old country, we'd call that a death sentence. No wins, no respect, no hope. It's like watching a man drown in shallow water - tragic, but also his own damn fault. Sometimes in this business, you got to know when to fold, when to walk away from the table. Aaron, he's still sitting there, bleeding chips."

### Matt's Syndicate Edges Out Sean's Operation (117.0 to 112.0)

*The Don's expression grows serious as he examines the papers.*

"Now this - this was a real sit-down. Matt's crew squeaking by with 117, Sean's boys coming up just short at 112. Five points. In this business, that's the difference between breathing and not breathing."

"Matt's got himself a cornerstone in Christian McCaffrey - 28 points, reliable as sunrise, deadly as nightfall. That's your franchise player, your consigliere. A.J. Brown with 25, DeVonta Smith with 20 - that's a receiving corps that could make grown men weep."

"Sean, he came to play. Justin Herbert and Joe Flacco - yeah, you heard me right, Joe fucking Flacco - combining for 57 points between them. That's like bringing your grandfather to a street fight and watching him clean house. Chris Olave adding 22? That's a respectable showing."

*The Don leans forward, his voice dropping to a whisper.*

"But here's where Sean made his mistake - Kendre Miller on IR. In this game, you can't afford dead weight. Every roster spot is precious, like bullets in a shootout. You waste one, it might be the one that costs you everything."

"Both these crews are 2-5 now, fighting for scraps at the bottom of the table. But at least they're fighting. That's more than some can say."

### Joe's Outfit Handles Business Against Eli's Crew (99.5 to 93.0)

*The Don's weathered hands flip through more papers.*

"Joe's sitting pretty at 6-1, and even on an off week - 99.5 points - he finds a way to win. That's what separates the bosses from the button men."

"Jonathan Taylor, 30 points. That's what I call a professional. Shows up every week, does his job, collects his envelope. No drama, no excuses. Just results. In this business, reliability is worth more than gold."

"But Joe's got problems brewing. Saquon Barkley, Justin Fields, Rachaad White - all zeroes. That's like having your best soldiers no-show for a war. Against a stronger opponent, that gets you fitted for concrete shoes."

"Eli tried to capitalize. Patrick Mahomes with 24, still got that championship swagger. Trey McBride with 19, CeeDee Lamb with 17 - those are solid numbers from solid players. But when David Montgomery, Tua Tagovailoa, and T.J. Hockenson all put up donuts? That's a massacre waiting to happen."

*The Don sighs deeply.*

"Both crews are struggling with injuries, with no-shows. But Joe found a way. That's why he's 6-1 and Eli's 4-3. In this game, you either find a way or find an excuse."

### Pete's Soldiers Fall to Mitch's Last Stand (95.5 to 59.5)

*The Don's face darkens as he reviews the final matchup.*

"And then there's this... situation. Pete putting up 95.5 points should have been enough for a comfortable victory. Matthew Stafford leading the charge with 31 points - that's veteran leadership, that's knowing how to survive in this jungle."

"But Mitch... Madonna mia, what a disaster. 59.5 points? That's not a score, that's a cry for help. That's the sound of a family empire crumbling. Chuba Hubbard, Brian Robinson Jr., George Kittle, Cooper Kupp, Kareem Hunt - all zeros. ZEROS! In my day, we'd have lined them up against a wall."

*The Don slams his hand on the desk, making the crystal glasses jump.*

"The only guy who showed up was Keenan Allen with 17 points. One soldier fighting while the rest of the army deserts? That's not a team, that's a funeral waiting to happen."

"Pete's 3-4 now, still in the hunt but bleeding. Mitch is also 3-4, but after a performance like this? The other families smell blood in the water. When you show weakness like this, the sharks start circling."

## The Hierarchy of Respect: Know Your Place

*The Don stands, walking to the window, looking out at his empire.*

"Let me break down the current power structure for you, so you understand who runs what in this thing of ours:

**The Untouchables (6-1):**
- Chris's crew - 128.5 points this week
- Joe's outfit - 99.5 points this week

These are your made men. They've earned their stripes, paid their dues. When they walk into a room, everyone else better show respect.

**The Muscle (4-3 to 5-2):**
- Matt's syndicate (5-2) - 117.0 points
- Bruce's brigade (4-3) - 118.0 points
- Eli's organization (4-3) - 93.0 points
- Cal's family (4-3) - 85.0 points

These crews, they're still in the game. Still dangerous. Any given week, they could take out a top dog. That's what makes this business exciting.

**The Desperate (2-5 to 3-4):**
- Dan's operation (3-4) - 116.5 points
- Mitch's crew (3-4) - 59.5 points
- Pete's soldiers (3-4) - 95.5 points
- Mike's assassins (2-5) - 134.0 points
- Sean's outfit (2-5) - 112.0 points

These guys are fighting for their lives. Some, like Mike this week, show they've got championship heart even in defeat. Others, like Mitch, are just going through the motions.

**The Walking Dead (0-7):**
- Aaron's ghost ship - 96.5 points

When you're 0-7, you're not even at the table anymore. You're the cautionary tale we tell the young guys."

## The Injury List: Our Fallen Soldiers

*The Don pulls out a black leather notebook.*

"We honor our wounded. These men gave their blood for the family:

- **Aaron's Crew**: Jakobi Meyers (Out), Kyler Murray (Out)
- **Bruce's Brigade**: Brock Bowers (Out)
- **Eli's Organization**: Joe Mixon (Out)
- **Mike's Assassins**: Mike Evans (Out - broken collarbone, done for most of the year)
- **Mitch's Crew**: Puka Nacua (Out)
- **Pete's Soldiers**: Brandon Aiyuk (Out)
- **Sean's Outfit**: Kendre Miller (IR - placed this week)

Some will return. Others, like Evans, their season might be sleeping with the fishes."

## The Final Word: Wisdom From The Don

*The Don returns to his chair, the leather creaking under his weight. He lights a fresh cigar, the smoke curling up like souls ascending.*

"Week 7 taught us valuable lessons. Mike showed us that even from the bottom, you can still command respect with a 134-point beating. Chris and Joe proved that consistency - not flashiness - builds empires. And Mitch... Mitch reminded us all what happens when you come unprepared to a gunfight."

"As we head into Week 8, remember this: In fantasy football, like in our thing, there are no friends, only interests. Every lineup decision is a calculated risk. Every waiver claim is a power move. Every trade is a negotiation where someone gets hurt."

*The Don stands, signaling the meeting is over.*

"Some of you will make the playoffs. Others will be eliminated. But remember - in this family, we play to win. Not for today, not for tomorrow, but for the championship. That's the only currency that matters in this business."

"Now get out of here. Go kiss your wives, hug your children, and prepare for next week. Because in this game, there's always another score to settle, another debt to collect."

*He pauses at the door.*

"And remember - keep your friends close, but keep your fantasy opponents closer. Capisce?"

*The door closes. The meeting is over. But the family business... the family business never sleeps.*
