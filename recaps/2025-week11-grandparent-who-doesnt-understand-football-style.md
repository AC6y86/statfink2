## A Letter From Grandma About Your "Fantasy Touchball" League Thing

Well hello there, sweethearts! It's me again, trying to understand this whole "fantasy football" business that you kids are always talking about at Thanksgiving. I've been watching the computer screen that Joey set up for me (such a good boy, that Joey), and I have SO many questions! But first, let me tell you what I saw this week in your little football club.

Now, I know it's called Week 11, but when I looked at the scores, everything said zero! Did everyone forget to show up? Is this like when your grandfather forgot about our anniversary that one time? So I looked at Week 10 instead (I hope that's okay, I don't want to break any rules). The nice computer man at Best Buy said I could click anything I wanted, but I'm still scared I'll delete the internet.

## The Big Winner Boy (Or Was It A Touchdown? A Home Run?)

Oh my stars and garters! That sweet Christopher boy scored 154 whole points! Now, I don't understand how you can score 154 points in football - when I watch it on TV with Grandpa (God rest his soul, he's just napping), they only score like 7 or 14 points. But Christopher had 154! His momma must be so proud. I remember when Christopher was just a little tyke, always playing with those Pokemon cards. Is this like Pokemon? Are the players like Pokemon that you collect?

Christopher had this nice young man named De'Von Achane who got 31 points all by himself! De'Von - what a lovely name! Is he French? And there was another boy, TreVeyon Henderson, who scored 25 points. TreVeyon sounds like such a modern name - back in my day, everyone was just named Bob or Steve. These kids today with their fancy names! I bet their grandmothers have a hard time writing them on birthday cards.

Poor Calvin (or Cal, as the kids call him) only got 122.5 points. Now how do you get half a point? Did someone only run halfway to the touchdown basket? Calvin's player Caleb Williams got 22 points - oh, TWO Calebs! Or wait, is Calvin's real name Caleb? I'm so confused. Anyway, young Caleb Williams seems like a nice boy. Is he the one dating that Taylor Swift? No wait, that's the other football boy. There are so many footballs to keep track of!

## Joey's Big Adventure (My Grandson, Not The Kangaroo Movie)

Now here's where I got REALLY confused, honeys. My Joey (such a smart boy, he helped me set up my Facebook) somehow LOST to Daniel even though Joey scored 134 points and Daniel only scored 93.5 points! How does that work? Is it like golf where lower is better? Or did they switch the numbers around? 

Joey had this Jonathan Taylor fellow who scored 39 WHOLE POINTS! Thirty-nine! That's almost forty! When I was thirty-nine, I had already had three kids. This Jonathan must be very fast. He plays for something called "IND" - is that Indianapolis? Or India? I hope if it's India he's staying hydrated, it's very hot there.

Joey also had Mac Jones (what kind of name is Mac? Is it short for Macaroni?) who scored 24 points, and Jacoby Brissett with 21 points. Jacoby is such a nice biblical name! His mother must go to church. But here's the thing that makes NO sense - even with all these points, the computer says Daniel won! Daniel's team was like watching your Uncle Harold try to parallel park - not pretty, but somehow it worked out!

## The Other Nice Boys and Their Sportsball Teams

Michael (Mike) and Eli had their own little competition, and Michael won 99.5 to 80.5. Michael had this Jahmyr Gibbs boy who scored 33 points! Jahmyr - now is that pronounced "Jah-meer" or "Jay-mer"? These young people and their creative spellings! Jahmyr plays for DET, which I think is Detroit? Or is it Detention? Are these boys in detention? That's not very nice!

Michael also had Baker Mayfield with 24 points. Baker! Now there's a good solid name. I bet his mother makes excellent pies. You know who needs to make better pies? Eli, apparently, because he only scored 80.5 points and his poor Joe Mixon is hurt! The computer says Joe has a foot AND ankle problem. How do you hurt both? Was he doing that TikTok dancing?

## Peter and Sean's Nail-Biter (Is That A Football Term?)

Peter beat Sean 96 to 94, which sounds like they were checking their temperatures! That's so close! Peter had Matthew Stafford (another good biblical name!) who scored 29 points, and Jared Goff with 24 points. Wait, Goff? Like cough but with a G? These names!

But oh dear, Peter's Brandon Aiyuk is hurt with a knee problem. You know what's good for knees? My special liniment! I'll send Peter some. And Sean, that poor dear, had BOTH Garrett Wilson AND Rhamondre Stevenson hurt! Rhamondre! Now that's a name that would give me trouble at Scrabble club. Sean only lost by 2 points - that's like losing a baking contest because you forgot one chocolate chip!

## The Basement Boys (That's Not Mean, Is It?)

Now, I don't want to be mean, but some of these boys need to practice more. Mitchell and Bruce had a game where Mitchell scored 78.5 and Bruce scored 67.5. Those aren't very many touchdowns, are they? Or are they? I still don't understand the scoring.

Bruce, sweetheart, you're 6-4 in the standings (is that your height?), but you've scored 1007 points total! That's more than my Social Security check! Wait, is this real money? AM I SUPPOSED TO BE BETTING? Oh dear, I hope not, Father O'Malley would not approve.

And then there's Aaron and Matthew (such nice biblical names!). Aaron scored 74 points and Matthew only got 49.5. Matthew, honey, are you eating enough? 49.5 points sounds like you need some of my chicken soup. Aaron had someone named Jaxson Dart who scored 25 points. Dart? Like the thing you throw at a board in a bar? Is this boy throwing things? That doesn't seem safe!

## The Injury Ward (Or Is It Called The Dugout?)

Oh my goodness, so many boys are hurt! This seems very dangerous! Here's what my computer is telling me:

**The Walking Wounded** (That's what Grandpa called them in the war):
- Jayden Daniels is "Out" - Out where? Did he go to the store?
- Kyler Murray has a "mid-foot sprain" and is on something called "Injured Reserve" - that sounds like a fancy hotel!
- Marvin Harrison Jr. had his appendix out! Poor boy! I'll send him some Jell-O.
- Joe Mixon hurt his foot AND ankle (still don't understand how)
- Terry McLaurin is out - Terry? That could be a boy or a girl! Very modern!
- Brandon Aiyuk has a bad knee (definitely needs my liniment)
- Garrett Wilson hurt his knee too - these boys need to be more careful!
- Rhamondre Stevenson hurt his toe - A TOE? You can't play with a hurt toe? When I was young, we walked to school with hurt toes, uphill, both ways!

## The Standings (Or Is It The Scorecard? The Leaderboard? Help!)

According to my notes (I wrote them on the back of my grocery list), here's how everyone is doing:

**The Good Boys:**
- Christopher: 8 wins, 2 losses (That's an A- in my book!)
- Joey: 8 wins, 2 losses (Also an A-! Two smart boys!)

**The Pretty Good Boys:**
- Bruce: 6-4 (Is that a fraction? 6/4 = 1.5?)
- Matthew: 6-4 (Another 1.5!)
- Calvin: 5-5 (That's perfectly average! Nothing wrong with average!)
- Peter: 5-5 (Also average! You boys could start a club!)
- Eli: 5-5 (So much average! It's like you planned it!)

**The Boys Who Need More Practice:**
- Daniel: 4-6 (But he beat Joey somehow? This is like Common Core math!)
- Michael: 4-6 (Needs more Baker Mayfield pies)
- Mitchell: 4-6 (Try harder, sweetie)
- Sean: 3-7 (Oh honey, let me make you some cookies)
- Aaron: 2-8 (Two wins is still two more than zero! Stay positive!)

## My Questions For You Smart Kids

1. Why do some players have teams with just letters? LAR? DET? IND? Are these abbreviations? Acronyms? Text message speak? LOL! (Am I using that right?)

2. How does Joey score 134 points but lose to someone with 93.5 points? Is this that "new math" everyone complains about?

3. Why is everyone always hurt? Don't they wear those helmets? Maybe they need bigger helmets. Or bubble wrap. I have some bubble wrap from my Amazon orders I could send.

4. What's a "bye week"? Some players had them. Are they saying goodbye? That seems sad. Bye bye, players!

5. Is "fantasy football" different from regular football? Do they use their imaginations? Like when you kids used to play pretend?

6. Why do they call it a "roster"? Like a rooster? Are there chickens involved? That would explain all the running around.

7. Someone told me about "defensive bonuses" - is that like when I get a bonus coupon at the grocery store?

8. What's a "waiver wire"? Is someone waving? A wire seems dangerous on a football field.

9. Why do some teams have possessive names (Chris's Team, Joe's Team) but no fun names? When I was in bowling league, we were "Grandma's Gutterballers"!

10. Is this gambling? Should I tell Father O'Malley? He's very strict about gambling, except for Bingo night, but that's for charity.

## Looking Forward (Or Is It Backward? Time Is Confusing)

Well, my dears, Week 11 (or is it 12 now?) is coming up, and everyone seems to have zero points so far. I hope that changes! It would be very boring if everyone just scored zero. Is this because of the daylight saving time? I never did understand why we change the clocks.

Christopher and Joey are tied for first place, which is nice - they should share! Sharing is caring! Although in my day, we didn't have ties in first place. Someone had to win. But you kids today with your participation trophies and your TikToks and your fantasy sports...

I hope all those injured boys feel better soon. Maybe they should drink more milk? Calcium is good for bones. And Marvin Harrison Jr., sweetie, take it easy after that appendix surgery! No heavy lifting! Or heavy footballing? Is footballing a word?

## A Final Thought From Grandma

I may not understand your fantasy football (why is it fantasy? why not reality football?), but I can see you're all having fun with your little number games. It reminds me of when Grandpa used to do his crossword puzzles, except with more injuries and math that doesn't make sense.

Keep playing your games, dearies, and remember: it doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's how you... wait, no, Joey tells me it DOES matter if you win or lose. Something about "playoffs"? Are those like layoffs? I hope nobody gets laid off!

Also, could someone explain why it's called "fantasy"? Are there dragons? Wizards? Is Harry Potter involved? That nice Daniel Radcliffe seems too small for football, but what do I know?

All my love,
Grandma

P.S. - I accidentally clicked something and now my computer is making noise. Is that normal? It says something about "updating Windows" - should I close my actual windows? It's getting chilly.

P.P.S. - Tell Christopher congratulations on scoring 154 points! That's more points than my age! Well, almost. Don't tell anyone I said that.

P.P.P.S. - Joey, dear, even though the computer says you lost, you're still a winner to me! Also, please come help me with this Windows thing. I'm scared.

P.P.P.P.S. - Is four P.S.'s too many? Your grandfather always said I talk too much. But he's napping again, so he can't complain!
