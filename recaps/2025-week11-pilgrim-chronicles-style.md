# The Pilgrim Chronicles: Week XI of the Season of Our Lord, 2025

## A Most Faithful Account of the Eleventh Sabbath of Fantasy Footballe, as Recorded by the Humble Scribe of the Colonies

---

*Being a true and accurate journale of the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of twelve brave settlers in the New World of Fantasy Footballe, wherein fortunes were made and lost upon the frozen November ground.*

---

## Prologue: The Gathering Storm

Hearken, good readers, and lend thine ears to this humble chronicler! 'Twas the eleventh week of our season in this harsh and unforgiving land of Fantasy Footballe, when the leaves had fallen from the trees and the bite of winter did creep upon our settlements. The twelve owners of this colony, weary from months of toil, did gather once more to test their mettle against one another.

The average settler in our faire league hath scored approximately 95.3 points across the full season's labours, yet this week proved more barren than most, with a meager average of but 90.5 points falling upon each household. Some would feast upon great bounty whilst others would surely starve. Such is the way of the New World, where the strong surviveth and the weak are cast into the wilderness.

As I set quill to parchment by candlelight, I shall endeavour to recount the six great contests that defined this memorable Sabbath, from the grandest triumph to the most pitiful defeat.

## The Headliner: Settler Chris's Magnificent Harvest (155.0 Points)

### *"And lo, Josh Allen did rain fire upon the land like Moses calling down plagues upon Egypt"*

Never in all mine years of recording the deeds of these colonists have I witnessed such a bountiful harvest as that which befell the settlement of **Chris's Team** upon this blessed week! With a staggering **155.0 points**, Settler Chris hath collected the greatest haul of the entire season, a bounty so magnificent that it caused neighbouring settlers to weep with envy and gnash their teeth in despair.

The centrepiece of this glorious harvest was none other than **Josh Allen**, the great Quarterback of Buffalo, who did score an almost unholy **48.0 points** upon the frozen tundra. 'Twas as if the Good Lord Himself had guided Allen's arm, for every pass found its mark, every scramble gained precious yardage. Truly, this was a performance for the ages, one that shall be spoken of in hushed tones around many a hearth fire for generations to come.

But the blessings did not end there, good readers! **Dak Prescott**, Chris's secondary field marshal, contributed **29.0 points** of his own, whilst the young running back **TreVeyon Henderson** burst through defensive lines like a bull through a wooden fence, accumulating **27.0 points**. Even the lesser contributors - **Jameson Williams** with 14.0 points, **De'Von Achane** with 9.0, and **Jake Ferguson** at tight end with 8.0 - all pulled their weight in this communal effort.

Some might question the wisdom of rostering three quarterbacks upon the active scroll, yet who amongst us would question such methods when they yield 155 points? Settler Chris now standeth at a proud **9-2 record**, tied for first in the colony with the great Joe's Team. The harvest hath been plentiful, and winter shall not claim this settlement.

## The Great Matchups: Six Contests of Will and Fortune

### MATCHUP THE FIRST: Chris's Team (155.0) vs. Eli's Team (79.0)

#### *"A tale of plenty and famine, wherein one feasted whilst the other went hungry"*

If ever there existed a more one-sided affair in the history of our colony, this humble scribe hath not witnessed it! Settler Chris descended upon poor Eli's homestead like a **76-point hurricane**, leaving naught but devastation in his wake. The margin of victory - **76.0 points** - was so vast that Eli's settlers could scarce see Chris's men disappearing over the horizon.

Whilst Chris's roster overflowed with bounty, **Eli's Team** suffered through what can only be described as a Biblical famine. The great **Amon-Ra St. Brown**, that shining star of Detroit, produced **0.0 points**. **David Montgomery**, the reliable workhorse, likewise contributed **nothing**. **T.J. Hockenson**, **Tua Tagovailoa**, **Darnell Mooney** - all zeros, like empty barrels in a drought-stricken storehouse!

Only **Kenneth Gainwell** (22.0 points) and **Trey McBride** (17.0 points) showed any signs of life for the besieged Eli, along with a modest 14.0 from **Patrick Mahomes**. But when seven of thine players fail to harvest a single point, no amount of individual heroism can save thee.

Eli now falleth to **5-6 on the season**, his playoff hopes growing dimmer with each passing week. The winter storms of defeat are gathering, and his settlement may not survive until spring.

---

### MATCHUP THE SECOND: Cal's Team (109.5) vs. Dan's Team (98.0)

#### *"The young running back Bijan proved mightier than all of Dan's eleven combined"*

In the fertile lands of Cal's settlement, the harvest was strong and true. **Cal's Team** claimed victory by a margin of **11.5 points**, a hard-fought battle against the scrappy settlers of Dan's homestead.

At the heart of Cal's triumph stood **Bijan Robinson**, the Atlanta running back, who did churn through defenses for **25.0 points**. Alongside him, the **Pittsburgh Steelers defense** contributed a stalwart **16.0 points**, proving that sometimes the best offense is a stout wall of iron-willed defenders. **Trevor Lawrence** added 13.0 points from the quarterback position, whilst **Drake London** and **Jaxon Smith-Njigba** each provided 9.0 points of receiving excellence.

Settler Dan's forces fought valiantly, but could not muster enough strength. **Kyren Williams** led the charge with 14.0 points, supported by **Kenneth Walker III** and **Deebo Samuel** (11.0 each), plus an unexpected 11.0 from the backup quarterback **Marcus Mariota**. Yet when thy highest scorer achieves merely 14.0 points whilst thy opponent boasts a 25.0-point running back, the battle is already lost before the sun sets.

Cal now standeth at **6-5**, clinging to the middle of the pack, whilst Dan falls to a concerning **4-7** record. The playoff harvest may yet elude both, but Cal's prospects appear decidedly brighter.

---

### MATCHUP THE THIRD: Pete's Team (98.0) vs. Aaron's Team (60.0)

#### *"Wherein the unknown Sean Tucker emerged from the wilderness like a gift from Providence"*

Who amongst us had heard of **Sean Tucker** before this fateful week? Certainly not this humble chronicler! Yet the Tampa Bay running back did burst upon the scene with **33.0 glorious points**, leading Pete's settlement to a commanding **38.0-point victory** over the struggling Aaron's Team.

Settler Pete's roster showed remarkable depth, with **Nico Collins** contributing 14.0 points, **Jared Goff** and **Travis Kelce** each adding 14.0 as well, and **Matthew Stafford** providing 10.0 points from the backup quarterback position. 'Twas a balanced attack, the kind that wins campaigns and builds empires.

Aaron's forces, by contrast, resembled a ragtag band of refugees more than a conquering army. Only **Tetairoa McMillan** (25.0 points) showed genuine brilliance, the young Arizona receiver proving his worth in the harsh wilderness. But behind him? **Mark Andrews** managed merely 8.0, **Bam Knight** scraped together 8.0, and too many others produced naught but goose eggs.

With a **2-9 record**, Aaron's Team now sits firmly in last place, the cellar-dweller of our colony. His settlement faces the harshest of winters, and many doubt whether it shall see the spring playoffs.

---

### MATCHUP THE FOURTH: Mitch's Team (93.0) vs. Sean's Team (76.0)

#### *"The San Francisco connection proved too powerful for the struggling Jets faithful"*

In a contest between two middle-tier settlements, **Mitch's Team** emerged with a **17-point victory**, thanks largely to the potent combination of **Brock Purdy** (21.0 points) and **George Kittle** (19.0 points). These two San Francisco faithful carried their colony upon their backs, as a pair of oxen might pull a heavy wagon through muddy roads.

**Xavier Legette** added 14.0 points from the Carolina receiving corps, whilst **Kareem Hunt** and **Stefon Diggs** contributed 11.0 and 9.0 respectively. 'Twas enough to overcome any resistance Sean's forces could muster.

Poor Settler Sean, who once dreamed of playoff glory, now finds himself at a dispiriting **3-8 record**. His best performers - **Travis Etienne Jr.** with 19.0 and **Devin Singletary** with 16.0 - fought admirably, but their efforts were undone by too many zeroes elsewhere in the lineup. **Justin Jefferson**, the mighty Viking, was held to a mere 3.0 points, whilst **Breece Hall** also managed only 3.0. When thy stars produce like replacement-level settlers, defeat is all but assured.

Mitch improves to **5-6**, keeping his playoff dreams barely alive. Sean, however, may need to start planning for next season's draft.

---

### MATCHUP THE FIFTH: Joe's Team (91.0) vs. Mike's Team (65.5)

#### *"The unlikely hero Jacoby Brissett doth remind us that Providence works in mysterious ways"*

Who would have predicted that **Jacoby Brissett**, a humble backup quarterback pressed into service, would lead Joe's Team to victory with **25.0 magnificent points**? Certainly not this chronicler, yet such is the unpredictable nature of Fantasy Footballe!

Joe's settlement claimed a **25.5-point victory**, maintaining their share of first place with a sterling **9-2 record**. Beyond Brissett, **George Pickens** flashed his immense talent with 17.0 points, whilst **Justin Fields** added 16.0 and **James Cook** contributed 11.0. 'Twas a workmanlike effort, lacking in superstars but brimming with solid contributions.

Mike's forces were undermined from the start by injury. **Tee Higgins**, his star receiver, was listed as OUT due to concussion and contributed 11.0 points (likely from before his departure). **Baker Mayfield** (13.0) and **Jordan Love** (12.0) did their best to rally the troops, but too many players failed to show. The **Packers defense**, the **Bills defense**, and various skill position players all registered zeros.

Mike falls to **4-7**, his playoff hopes fading like autumn leaves. Joe, meanwhile, continues to build one of the most dominant settlements in colony history.

---

### MATCHUP THE SIXTH: Matt's Team (94.0) vs. Bruce's Team (67.5)

#### *"The return of Christian McCaffrey heralded great tidings for Matt's settlement"*

Lo, the prodigal son hath returned! **Christian McCaffrey**, long absent from the fields of battle, exploded back into action with **30.0 stupendous points**, leading Matt's Team to a comfortable **26.5-point victory** over Bruce's beleaguered forces.

But McCaffrey was not the only star to shine brightly upon Matt's roster! **Bryce Young**, the once-maligned Carolina quarterback, put forth the performance of his young career with **32.0 points** - the second-highest individual score of the entire week! Combined with **Derrick Henry's** reliable 17.0 points, Matt possessed a triumvirate of running back and quarterback excellence that proved utterly unstoppable.

Bruce's Team, meanwhile, suffered through a nightmare of Biblical proportions. **Ja'Marr Chase** - one of the best receivers in all the land - produced **0.0 points**. **DK Metcalf**: zero. **Calvin Ridley** (on injured reserve): zero. **Nick Chubb**, **Jerry Jeudy**, **Marquise Brown** - all zeros! Only **Drake Maye** (14.0), **Bhayshul Tuten** (11.0), and a smattering of minor contributors prevented a complete catastrophe.

Matt rises to **7-4**, firmly in playoff contention, whilst Bruce slides to **6-5**, still within striking distance but wounded by this brutal defeat.

## The Performance Tiers: Separating the Strong from the Weak

### THE ELITE (100+ Points) - Those Who Shall Survive the Winter
Only two settlements achieved the hallowed 100-point threshold this week:
- **Chris's Team: 155.0 points** - The unquestioned Lord of the Manor
- **Cal's Team: 109.5 points** - A strong second harvest

### THE COMPETITIVE (90-99 Points) - Steady Homesteaders
Four settlements fell into this respectable middle ground:
- **Dan's Team: 98.0** (despite the loss)
- **Pete's Team: 98.0** (a victorious effort)
- **Matt's Team: 94.0** (CMC's triumphant return)
- **Mitch's Team: 93.0** (the 49ers connection)

### THE STRUGGLING (70-89 Points) - Bracing for Hard Times
Three settlements produced concerning harvests:
- **Joe's Team: 91.0** (just barely competitive)
- **Eli's Team: 79.0** (devastated by zeros)
- **Sean's Team: 76.0** (stars failing to shine)

### THE BASEMENT (Below 70 Points) - May God Have Mercy
Three settlements face starvation:
- **Bruce's Team: 67.5** (Ja'Marr Chase's failure was crushing)
- **Mike's Team: 65.5** (injuries and disappointments)
- **Aaron's Team: 60.0** (the cellar-dweller)

---

## The Bust Brigade: Those Who Failed Their Settlements

Let it be recorded for posterity that the following players did abandon their owners in their hour of greatest need:

**The Zero Club** - Players who produced absolutely nothing:
- **Ja'Marr Chase** (Bruce's Team) - One of the league's finest, rendered useless
- **Amon-Ra St. Brown** (Eli's Team) - The Sun God's light did not shine
- **Justin Herbert** (Sean's Team) - The Chargers' general was absent
- **A.J. Brown** (Matt's Team) - Even victors suffered zeroes
- **Josh Jacobs** (Chris's Team) - Fortunately, Chris had plenty to spare
- **Cooper Kupp** (Mitch's Team) - The veteran's struggles continue

---

## Close Calls and Heartbreaks

Whilst most contests this week were decided by comfortable margins, two battles proved more contentious:

**Cal vs. Dan (11.5 point margin)** - This was the week's closest contest, a back-and-forth affair where Dan's balanced attack nearly overcame Cal's Bijan Robinson-led charge. Had Dan's **Saquon Barkley** (merely 6.0 points) performed to his usual standard, the outcome might have been quite different.

**Mitch vs. Sean (17.0 point margin)** - Though not razor-thin, this contest saw Sean's **Justin Jefferson** (3.0 points) and **Breece Hall** (3.0 points) dramatically underperform. With even average production from these stars, Sean might have stolen a victory.

## Looking Ahead: The Path to Playoff Harvest

As we approach the final weeks of the regular season, the standings tell a tale of haves and have-nots:

**GUARANTEED HARVEST (9-2):**
- Chris's Team - The dominant force
- Joe's Team - Equally impressive

**PLAYOFF CONTENDERS (6-5 to 7-4):**
- Matt's Team (7-4) - Surging with CMC's return
- Pete's Team (6-5) - Needs consistency
- Cal's Team (6-5) - Bijan can carry them
- Bruce's Team (6-5) - Must stop the bleeding

**ON THE BUBBLE (5-6):**
- Mitch's Team - Every game is crucial
- Eli's Team - Desperately needs healthy players

**FACING THE WINTER (4-7 or worse):**
- Dan's Team (4-7) - Running out of time
- Mike's Team (4-7) - Injuries have crippled them
- Sean's Team (3-8) - Mathematically alive, spiritually defeated
- Aaron's Team (2-9) - Plan for next year's draft

## Epilogue: As the Candle Burns Low

And so concludeth the Chronicle of Week XI, a week that shall be remembered for Settler Chris's magnificent 155-point harvest, the triumphant return of Christian McCaffrey, and the continued struggles of those settlements plagued by injury and misfortune.

As I extinguish this candle and prepare for slumber, I am reminded that in this New World of Fantasy Footballe, fortunes change as quickly as the New England weather. Those who feast today may starve tomorrow, and those who suffer may yet find salvation.

Until next we gather, may thy players stay healthy, thy opponents' stars go cold, and thy waiver wire pickups prove fruitful.

*Signed and sealed this 27th day of November, in the year of our Lord 2025,*

*The Humble Chronicler of the Fantasy Footballe Colony*
