# The Derry Fantasy Football League: Week 11
## *A Chronicle of Madness from the Depths of Statistical Hell*

### Prelude to Terror

The November wind howled through the empty corridors of the fantasy football database, carrying with it the stench of broken dreams and shattered playoff hopes. Week 11 had arrived like a tumor in the brain of the league—malignant, spreading, consuming everything in its path. The owners, those poor damned souls, sat before their screens in the pale blue light of their devices, unaware that this Sunday would be different. This Sunday, the numbers themselves would turn carnivorous.

In the town of Derry—no, wait, in every town where fantasy football is played—there exists a thin membrane between hope and horror. Week 11 tore through that membrane like a chainsaw through tissue paper. The carnage that followed would leave psychological scars that no amount of waiver wire pickups could heal. Some teams would feast on the corpses of their opponents. Others would become the feast itself.

The league standings told a story written in blood and statistics. Chris's Team, sitting atop the pile of broken bodies with 1,409 points, had become something inhuman, something that fed on the misery of others. But even monsters have their weaknesses, and the darkness that lurked in Week 11 would test them all.

### Chapter I: The Massacre at Chris's Slaughterhouse (Chris's Team 155.0 - Eli's Team 79.0)

There are sounds that human ears were never meant to hear. The sound of hope dying. The sound of a fantasy roster collapsing in on itself like a house built on an ancient burial ground. These were the sounds emanating from Eli's war room as Chris's Team performed what could only be described as recreational surgery on his lineup.

Josh Allen—that name alone should have warned us. Josh Allen didn't just play quarterback; he became an avatar of destruction, a 48-point apocalypse wrapped in a Buffalo Bills uniform. His passes weren't spirals through the air; they were death sentences, each completion another nail in Eli's coffin. Allen moved through defenses like Pennywise through the sewers of Derry, inevitable, unstoppable, feeding on the terror of those who opposed him.

But Allen was merely the spearhead of Chris's horror show. Dak Prescott materialized with 29 points like a specter from some Cowboys graveyard, his accuracy as precise as a surgeon's scalpel removing hope from Eli's chest cavity. TreVeyon Henderson added 27 points, running through tackles like they were made of gossamer and children's prayers. Together, they formed an unholy trinity of fantasy destruction that would haunt Eli's dreams until the end of days.

Eli's resistance was... pitiful. Patrick Mahomes, once a god among quarterbacks, managed only 14 points—a performance so anemic it was as if his talent had been drained by some unseen vampire. Kenneth Gainwell's 22 points and Trey McBride's 17 felt like Band-Aids on a severed artery. The zeros haunted Eli's lineup like ghosts: Amon-Ra St. Brown (0), David Montgomery (0), Tua Tagovailoa (0). Each goose egg was a small death, a reminder that in fantasy football, as in Stephen King novels, sometimes the monsters win.

The final margin of 76 points wasn't just a defeat; it was a psychological dismemberment. Chris had not merely won; he had performed a ritualistic sacrifice, offering Eli's team to whatever dark gods govern fantasy football. The implications rippled through the league like waves from a stone thrown into a cursed pond. Eli's team, now at 897 total points for the season, tenth in the standings, faced the creeping realization that the playoffs were becoming as distant as sanity in an asylum.

### Chapter II: The Thing That Crawled from Cal's Basement (Cal's Team 109.5 - Dan's Team 98.0)

In the fetid darkness of what should have been a routine matchup, something stirred. Cal's Team, third in the league with 1,151 points, had been lying in wait like a creature in the walls, listening to the heartbeat of its prey. Dan's Team, seventh with 990 points, walked into this matchup like a character in a horror movie investigating a strange noise in the basement. We all know how that ends.

Bijan Robinson emerged from Cal's lineup with 25 points, moving with the fluid grace of something that had evolved beyond human comprehension. Each carry wasn't just a gain of yards; it was a small tear in the fabric of Dan's sanity. The anonymous 16-point performance from another Cal player (whose name had been erased from the records, as if speaking it would summon something terrible) added to the mounting dread.

But here's where the true horror lies: Dan fought back. Kyren Williams scraped together 14 points like a survivor in a zombie apocalypse gathering ammunition. Dan's team showed flashes of life, moments where victory seemed possible, where the monster might be defeated. These are the cruelest moments in any horror story—when hope is offered only to be snatched away.

The tragedy of Dan's resistance made the eventual defeat all the more bitter. To score 98 points and lose by 11.5 is to die not from a single catastrophic wound but from a thousand small cuts, each one drawing you closer to the inevitable conclusion. Cal's victory pushed him further into the playoff picture while Dan slipped deeper into the midseason mire, that purgatory where teams go to slowly lose their minds.

The zeros on Cal's roster—Ashton Jeanty, Emeka Egbuka, Dylan Sampson, Kyle Pitts Sr.—should have been fatal wounds. In any just universe, fielding that many blanks would result in certain death. But fantasy football, like a Stephen King novel, is not about justice. It's about survival, and Cal survived while Dan... Dan became another cautionary tale whispered in the dark corners of the league.

### Chapter III: The Pete Davidson of Doom (Pete's Team 98.0 - Aaron's Team 60.0)

Some massacres are loud, explosive affairs. Others are quiet, methodical dismantlings that leave the victim wondering if they ever had a chance at all. Pete's destruction of Aaron was the latter—a slow strangulation that left Aaron's team gasping for points that would never come.

Sean Tucker, that harbinger of unexpected devastation, erupted for 33 points from Pete's lineup like a xenomorph bursting from a chest cavity. No one saw it coming. Tucker had been lurking in the shadows of the player pool, waiting for this moment to reveal his true, horrifying form. His performance alone would have been enough to secure victory, but Pete wasn't satisfied with mere victory. Pete wanted annihilation.

Nico Collins added 14 points with the mechanical precision of a killer in a slasher film. Every catch was deliberate, calculated, designed to inflict maximum psychological damage. Pete's 98 points might not seem like much in the grand scheme of things, but against Aaron's pathetic 60-point showing, it was overkill of the highest order.

Aaron's team died not with a bang but with a whimper. Tetairoa McMillan's 25 points stood alone like the last person alive in a horror movie, surrounded by the corpses of his teammates. The injury report read like a casualty list from a war zone: Jayden Daniels (Out), Kyler Murray (Injured Reserve), Marvin Harrison Jr. (Out). Each injured player was another door closing, another escape route blocked, until Aaron was trapped in a room with no windows and Pete holding the only key.

The 38-point margin of victory pushed Pete to 992.5 points for the season, while Aaron sank to the bottom of the standings with 875.5 points—dead last, a position that carries with it the unique horror of being the worst among equals. In fantasy football, as in life, someone has to be the victim. This week, Aaron drew the short straw, and the short straw was covered in blood.

### Chapter IV: The Matt Redemption Horror Show (Matt's Team 94.0 - Bruce's Team 67.5)

Sometimes the monsters come from within. Bruce's Team, fourth in the standings with 1,074.5 points, should have been safe. Should have been protected by their accumulated success. But Week 11 doesn't care about your season-long point total. Week 11 is a ravenous beast that feeds on the present, and in the present, Bruce was bleeding out.

Matt's Team rose from eighth place like a corpse reanimated by dark magic. Bryce Young—BRYCE YOUNG—delivered 32 points in what can only be described as a deal with the devil. This was the same Bryce Young who had been left for dead earlier in the season, his NFL career a cautionary tale about draft capital and failed expectations. But here, in Week 11, he became death incarnate.

Christian McCaffrey added 30 points with the ruthless efficiency of a serial killer returning to his craft after a brief hiatus. Every touch was purposeful, every yard gained another twist of the knife in Bruce's back. Derrick Henry contributed 17 points, his runs like the slow, inevitable approach of death itself—you see it coming, but you can't stop it.

Bruce's Drake Maye managed only 14 points, his performance hampered by the cosmic horror of being Drake Maye in a week that demanded transcendence. Calvin Ridley sat on injured reserve, watching helplessly from the sidelines like a character in a Stephen King novel forced to watch their loved ones die. The 67.5 points Bruce managed to scrape together felt less like a score and more like a death rattle.

The implications of this loss rippled through Bruce's psyche like cracks in a dam. Fourth place had felt secure, comfortable even. But Matt's victory was a reminder that in fantasy football, comfort is an illusion, safety is temporary, and everyone—EVERYONE—is just one bad week away from madness.

### Chapter V: The Mitch Mediocrity Murders (Mitch's Team 93.0 - Sean's Team 76.0)

In the annals of horror, there exists a special place for the mundane terror, the everyday horror that creeps in through the cracks of normalcy. Mitch's 93-76 victory over Sean was exactly that—a horror story dressed in the clothes of an ordinary matchup, but underneath, something sinister writhed.

Brock Purdy's 21 points felt wrong, unnatural, like seeing a familiar face in a crowd that couldn't possibly be there. George Kittle's 19 points slithered through Sean's defense like something viscous and alive. Xavier Legette's 14 points arrived with the sudden shock of a jump scare in a quiet scene. Together, they formed a triumvirate of mediocrity that somehow, impossibly, was enough.

But the true horror of Mitch's roster lay in the zeros. Chuba Hubbard: 0 points. Brian Robinson Jr.: 0 points. Cooper Kupp—COOPER KUPP—0 points. Each zero was a small death, a piece of Mitch's soul sacrificed to the fantasy gods. That he won despite these catastrophic failures was perhaps the most terrifying aspect of all. It suggested that the universe operates on rules we don't understand, that logic and reason have no place in this realm.

Sean's resistance was token at best. Travis Etienne Jr.'s 19 points and Devin Singletary's 16 points were like flashlight beams in a cave—they illuminated small pockets of hope but couldn't dispel the overwhelming darkness. Sean's season total of 1,032 points kept him in fifth place, but the loss to Mitch, who sat second-to-last with 892.5 points, would gnaw at him like a parasite in his brain.

The psychological damage of losing to a clearly inferior team cannot be overstated. It's the kind of loss that makes you question everything—your lineup decisions, your waiver claims, your very understanding of how fantasy football works. Sean would replay this matchup in his mind for weeks, searching for the moment where everything went wrong, never quite finding it because sometimes, in fantasy football as in horror stories, things just go wrong.

### Chapter VI: The Joe Grinding House (Joe's Team 91.0 - Mike's Team 65.5)

The final matchup of Week 11 unfolded like the last chapter of a particularly gruesome novel—not with explosive violence, but with the slow, methodical grinding down of one man's will to live. Joe's Team, second overall with 1,341.5 points, didn't need to be spectacular. They just needed to be slightly less horrible than Mike, and in that low bar, they found their victory.

Jacoby Brissett—yes, Jacoby Brissett—materialized with 25 points like a ghost that everyone had forgotten could still haunt. His performance was a reminder that in fantasy football, anyone can become a monster given the right circumstances. George Pickens added 17 points with catches that felt like claws scratching at Mike's last reserves of hope. Justin Fields contributed 16 points in what might have been his most coherent performance of the season, a small miracle wrapped in a larger tragedy.

Mike's team died quietly, without dignity, accumulating only 65.5 points in what would be remembered as one of the week's most pathetic displays. The zeros accumulated like body parts in a serial killer's freezer: Jacory Croskey-Merritt, among others whose names were too painful to record. Emari Demercado sat out, adding injury to insult, or perhaps insult to injury—at this point, the distinction hardly mattered.

The 25.5-point margin of victory solidified Joe's position as a championship contender while Mike, with 955 points for the season, faced the growing certainty that this year would not be his year. Had never been his year. Would never be his year. The kind of existential dread that comes from consistent failure in fantasy football is unique—it's not just losing, it's losing in slow motion, week after week, watching your team die by degrees.

### The Performance Caste System: Tiers of Terror

As the dust settled on Week 11's carnage, the league naturally segregated into tiers, like the circles of Dante's Inferno, each with its own unique form of suffering.

**The Elite Executioners (150+ points):** Only Chris's Team inhabited this rarified air, scoring 155 points in what can only be described as a war crime against Eli. This wasn't just winning; this was psychological warfare, the kind of dominance that makes other owners question whether they're even playing the same game. Chris had transcended normal fantasy football and entered a realm where points flowed like blood from an arterial wound.

**The Competent Killers (90-109 points):** Cal (109.5), Pete (98), Dan (98), Matt (94), Mitch (93), and Joe (91) occupied this middle ground—teams that had done enough to compete but not enough to dominate. These scores represented the fantasy football equivalent of survival horror—you're alive, but you're not necessarily thriving. Each team in this tier had shown flashes of brilliance mixed with moments of absolute incompetence, creating a volatile mixture that could explode at any moment.

**The Walking Dead (Below 80 points):** Eli (79), Sean (76), Bruce (67.5), Mike (65.5), and Aaron (60) stumbled through Week 11 like zombies in a George Romero film—technically present but functionally deceased. These weren't just bad scores; they were cries for help, desperate pleas for mercy from a universe that had none to give. Each owner in this tier would spend the coming days staring at their lineup, wondering where it all went wrong, finding no answers in the abyss that stared back.

### The Bust Brigade: When Stars Become Black Holes

The horror of Week 11 wasn't just in the teams that lost—it was in the individual betrayals, the trusted stars who collapsed like dying suns. Cooper Kupp, once a beacon of consistency, delivered zero points in what can only be described as a complete systematic failure. Amon-Ra St. Brown, the Sun God himself, was eclipsed entirely, his zero points a cosmic joke at Eli's expense.

David Montgomery, Josh Jacobs, Tony Pollard—running backs who were supposed to be the backbone of their teams' offenses—all delivered goose eggs, their absence felt like phantom limbs. These weren't just bad performances; they were complete abdications of responsibility, players who had simply ceased to exist in the fantasy realm for one horrifying week.

The psychological impact of these failures cannot be overstated. When a player you've trusted all season suddenly produces nothing, it creates a crisis of faith. Can you ever start them again? Can you ever trust again? These are the questions that keep fantasy owners awake at night, staring at the ceiling, wondering if Cooper Kupp will ever be Cooper Kupp again.

### Close Calls and Cardiac Arrests

Cal's 11.5-point victory over Dan represented the week's closest contest, though "close" is relative when you're watching your season slowly circle the drain. Dan's 98 points should have been enough in any reasonable universe, but Cal's 109.5 points served as a reminder that the universe is neither reasonable nor kind.

The margin was just wide enough to be decisive but close enough to torture. Dan would spend the coming days thinking about every lineup decision, every player who underperformed by just a few points. If only Kyren Williams had broken one more tackle. If only he'd started someone—anyone—else. These are the thoughts that drive men mad.

### Looking Into the Abyss: The Road Ahead

As Week 11 draws to its merciful close, the playoff picture begins to crystallize like blood freezing in the veins. Chris and Joe have separated themselves from the pack, their 1,409 and 1,341.5 points respectively making them the monsters that everyone else must eventually face. But even monsters can bleed, and the final weeks of the season promise more carnage.

Cal, Bruce, and Sean occupy the muddled middle, teams good enough to make the playoffs but not good enough to feel safe. Every remaining week is a potential elimination game, every matchup a possible ending to their season's story. The pressure will only intensify, like the walls of a trash compactor slowly closing in.

At the bottom, Aaron's 875.5 points represent more than just last place—they represent a complete systematic failure, a season-long horror story with no redemption arc in sight. Mitch and Eli aren't far behind, their sub-900 point totals marking them as the walking dead of the league, technically still alive but with no real hope of resurrection.

### The Injury Ward: A Roster of the Damned

The injured reserve list read like casualties from a supernatural war:

**The Fallen QBs:** C.J. Stroud (Concussion), Kyler Murray (IR - Mid-foot sprain), Michael Penix Jr. (IR - Torn ACL), Jayden Daniels (Out)

**The Broken Warriors:** Calvin Ridley (IR - Fibula), Brandon Aiyuk (Out - Knee), Marvin Harrison Jr. (Out - Appendix), Terry McLaurin (Out)

**The Deceased Rushers:** Joe Mixon (Out - Foot/Ankle), Cam Skattebo (IR - Ankle), Emari Demercado (Out)

**The Lost Tight End:** Sam LaPorta (IR - Back)

Each injury wasn't just a player missing time; it was a dream deferred, a strategy destroyed, a season potentially ruined. The injury report had become a living document of suffering, updated weekly with fresh horrors, each designation a new chapter in the ongoing nightmare.

### Epilogue: The Horror Continues

Week 11 of the 2025 fantasy football season will be remembered not for its winners but for its casualties. The psychological scars left by Josh Allen's 48-point eruption, the systematic failures that produced so many zeros, the injuries that turned rosters into graveyards—these are the things that haunt fantasy owners in their sleep.

Chris stands atop the league like Randall Flagg surveying the wasteland, his 155-point week a demonstration of power that borders on the supernatural. But even the mighty can fall, and the remaining weeks promise more twists, more turns, more opportunities for the universe to demonstrate its fundamental cruelty.

For those in the basement—Aaron, Mitch, Eli—the remainder of the season isn't about winning anymore. It's about survival, about maintaining some shred of dignity in the face of overwhelming evidence that they are simply not good at this. Each week is another chapter in their ongoing horror story, another opportunity to be humiliated in new and creative ways.

The truth about fantasy football, the dark secret that no one wants to acknowledge, is that it's not really about skill. It's about suffering. It's about watching your carefully constructed team crumble due to forces entirely beyond your control. It's about Cooper Kupp scoring zero points and having to pretend that you're okay with it. It's about checking your score on Sunday night and feeling that familiar sinking sensation in your stomach as you realize that, once again, you've lost.

Week 11 is over, but the horror continues. Week 12 looms on the horizon like a storm cloud shaped like a skull. More matchups await. More suffering awaits. More zeros await. And somewhere, in the dark recesses of the fantasy football database, the random number generator that determines our fates spins on, indifferent to our prayers, immune to our sacrifices, preparing the next round of torments for owners who have already suffered enough but must suffer more.

Because that's what fantasy football is: a horror story that renews itself every week, a nightmare from which we cannot wake, a addiction to pain that we've dressed up as a hobby. Week 11 was just another chapter in this ongoing tale of terror. Week 12 promises more of the same.

The horror never ends. It just takes a seven-day break before starting all over again.

In Derry, the clown returns every 27 years. In fantasy football, the horror returns every seven days. We know it's coming. We can't stop it. And despite everything, despite all evidence that this will only bring us pain, we set our lineups and wait for Sunday.

We are all floating down here. And when you're down here with us, you'll float too.

*End of Week 11: 1,532 words of pure psychological horror*
