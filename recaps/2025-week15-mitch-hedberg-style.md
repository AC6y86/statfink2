# Week 15 Fantasy Football Recap: The Mitch Hedberg Experience

*I used to play fantasy football. I still do, but I used to, too.*

---

## Setting the Stage, Man

Week 15, man. Fifteen. That's like... almost sixteen. I used to think Week 15 was the playoffs, but then I realized I don't know what I'm doing. The average team scored 117.25 points this week. That's a number. It's more than 117, but less than 118. I like that about it. It knows its place.

So we've got playoff matchups happening. Two of them. Chris versus Dan, Matt versus Bruce. The other teams? They're just out there scoring points. Points that don't matter in the standings but absolutely matter to their mothers. My mom asked me once, "How'd you do in fantasy this week?" I said, "I scored 140 points." She said, "Is that good?" And I realized I'd been playing this game for fifteen weeks and I still don't know the answer to that question.

The thing about Week 15 is that it's the last week before people start paying attention. It's like the week before Christmas. Everyone's excited, nobody's prepared, and Trevor Lawrence just scored 48 points for some reason.

## The Headliner: Trevor Lawrence Goes Nuclear

I saw Trevor Lawrence score 48 points this week. 48. That's two 24s. Or four 12s. Or 48 ones, if you're paying with exact change. He threw for 330 yards and 5 touchdowns. FIVE. I've never done anything five times in a row successfully. I once tried to flip a pancake five times and I burned down my apartment. Not the whole apartment, just the kitchen part. And the living room. Okay, the whole apartment.

Cal owned Trevor Lawrence this week, which is interesting because Cal's team also has Kyle Pitts, who scored 36 points. Kyle Pitts. I don't know why his name sounds like a place where they store gravel, but the man scored 36 points catching footballs. Together, Lawrence and Pitts scored 84 points. That's like having two teams that are each better than some actual teams. I once had a sandwich that was better than some actual sandwiches, but this is more impressive because I'm not good at making sandwiches.

Cal's team finished with 174 points this week. The problem is, Cal wasn't playing anyone. He was just accumulating. Like a guy at a salad bar who takes too much ranch. Sure, you have all that ranch, but what are you going to do with it? It's not going to help you in the standings. It's just going to sit there. Being ranch.

## Playoff Matchup: Chris Defeats Dan, 140.0 - 124.5

Chris beat Dan. I have to say "Chris beat Dan" instead of "Chris's Team beat Dan's Team" because that's like saying "I drove my car to the car place." You don't need the extra words. Chris knows he has a team. Dan knows he has a team. We all know. We're all in this together. Alone.

Chris scored 140 points, which is 22.75 above the league average. That's like being 22.75% better at something than you should be. Or maybe it's not. I'm not good at percentages. I got a 75 on a math test once, and the teacher said, "That's a C." And I said, "What's a C?" And she said, "It means you understood most of it." And I didn't understand what she meant. Which proved her point, I guess.

TreVeyon Henderson led Chris's squad with 25 points. He rushed for 148 yards and 2 touchdowns. That's a lot of yards. 148 yards is like... almost half of what my apartment is worth. Josh Allen added 21 points, Josh Jacobs chipped in 19, Tony Pollard contributed 17, and Jameson Williams also had 17. Chris had so many guys score between 17 and 25 points. That's called "balance." I don't have balance. I lean slightly to the left when I stand. Not for political reasons. Just structurally.

Dan put up 124.5 points, which sounds like it should be enough to win. But it wasn't. It's like ordering a medium drink when you really needed a large. You're close, but you're still thirsty. Kyren Williams scored 22 for Dan, rushing for 78 yards and 2 touchdowns. Aaron Rodgers added 16 points. Saquon Barkley, who I thought would dominate, only scored 14. Saquon Barkley scoring 14 points is like The Beatles playing a house party. It's still good, but you expected more. You expected Shea Stadium.

Dan advances to the third-place game now. Which is fine. Third place is still on the podium. It's the bronze medal of not quite making it. I once came in third in a pie-eating contest. They gave me a ribbon. It was blue. I think they ran out of bronze ribbons. Or maybe third place gets blue. I didn't ask questions. I was full of pie.

## Playoff Matchup: Matt Defeats Bruce, 108.0 - 91.0

Matt beat Bruce. 108 to 91. That's a 17-point difference. Seventeen. That's a prime number. I like prime numbers because they can't be divided evenly by anything except 1 and themselves. I relate to that. I can't be divided evenly either. I tried to split a bill once and I gave the waiter $47 for a $40 check because math is hard and I wanted to leave.

Matt's squad was led by J.J. McCarthy, who scored 27 points. McCarthy is a rookie, which means he's new at this, which means he's probably nervous, which means 27 points is even more impressive. It's like a kid selling lemonade and making $27. That's a lot of lemonade. C.J. Stroud added 24 points for Matt. DJ Moore chipped in 19. After that, things got sparse. Christian McCaffrey only scored 11. Derrick Henry only scored 9. Those are guys you draft early, man. They're supposed to carry you. Instead, they're being carried. By rookies. The rookies are carrying the veterans. It's like if the opening band headlined.

Bruce scored 91 points, which, again, sounds respectable until you realize he lost. Bo Nix was his top scorer with 29 points. Bo Nix. That name sounds like a magic trick that doesn't work. "And now, Bo Nix!" Nothing happens. Except this week something did happen: 29 points. Drake Maye added 16. DK Metcalf and Michael Wilson each scored 11. But then Bruce had guys like Brock Bowers and Ja'Marr Chase scoring almost nothing. Brock Bowers scored 0 points. Ja'Marr Chase scored 9. Ja'Marr Chase scoring 9 points is like Picasso drawing a stick figure. You know he can do better. He's just choosing not to. For reasons.

Bruce now faces Dan in the third-place game. Third place versus not-quite-first place. It's like a competition for who gets to be the best of the people who aren't the best. I competed for that once. I didn't win. I got fourth.

## The Accumulation Station: Teams Without Matchups

Joe scored 133 points this week, which would've beaten most people. But he wasn't playing anyone. He was just scoring. Into the void. James Cook III led the way with 33 points. That's a lot of cooking. Cook cooked. I once cooked something and it turned out okay. That's my whole cooking story. But Joe also had Jacoby Brissett and Jalen Hurts both score 21, and Dallas Goedert add 19. Meanwhile, Ladd McConkey, Xavier Worthy, Jaylen Warren, George Pickens, Jordan Mason, and Christian Kirk all scored 0. Zero. Six players scoring zero is like inviting six friends to your party and they all cancel. But they don't tell you. They just don't show up. And you're standing there with all these chips.

Eli put up 117 points, which is exactly the league average this week. EXACTLY. 117.25 was the average, and Eli scored 117. That's called being average. I'm average at a lot of things. Probably all things, actually. Eli's squad was led by Amon-Ra St. Brown with 28 points and Trey McBride with 25. Amon-Ra St. Brown. That's a name that sounds like it should be on a pyramid. Instead, it's on a fantasy roster. Catching touchdowns. For Eli. In Week 15.

Aaron scored 81 points. That's below average. Below average is like being on the first floor of a two-story building. You're still inside, but there's more above you. Jaxson Dart led Aaron's team with 19 points. Dart. That's a sharp name. Jauan Jennings added 16. But Jayden Daniels is out for the season now. He's got an elbow issue. Your elbow is important, man. It's the middle of your arm. Without your elbow, your arm is just a long straight thing that can't do anything.

## Performance Tiers: A Hierarchy of Points

**The Penthouse (130+ points):**
- Cal: 174.0 - I'd say Cal crushed it, but he wasn't crushing anything. He was just existing. Aggressively.
- Chris: 140.0 - Won his playoff game. Moving on. Like a guy who finished his appetizer and is ready for the entree.
- Joe: 133.0 - High score, no opponent. All dressed up and no matchup to go.

**The Nice Apartment (100-130 points):**
- Pete: 130.0 - Pete had Matthew Stafford and Jared Goff both score 22 points. Two quarterbacks scoring the same thing. That's called synchronization. Or coincidence. Probably coincidence.
- Dan: 124.5 - Lost his playoff game but scored well. Moral victories aren't victories but they are moral.
- Eli: 117.0 - Perfectly average. Right in the middle. The median of mediocrity.
- Matt: 108.0 - Won his game despite not being spectacular. That's called efficiency. Or luck.

**The Basement With Character (Below 100 points):**
- Bruce: 91.0 - Lost his playoff matchup. Now plays for third. Bronze is still a medal.
- Aaron: 81.0 - Struggling. His quarterback is done for the year. Life is hard.
- Mitch: 77.0 - Brock Purdy scored 24 and George Kittle had 14, but everyone else? Problems. Eight players scored zero. EIGHT. That's like a baseball team where only the pitcher shows up.
- Sean: 76.0 - Travis Etienne scored 27 but Justin Jefferson, Breece Hall, and Jaylen Waddle all scored 0. Your stars need to star, man.
- Mike: 74.5 - Baker Mayfield scored 21. Everyone else forgot to play. Jahmyr Gibbs: 0. Romeo Doubs: 0. Zero is a powerful number. It means nothing. Literally.

## The Bust Brigade: Stars Who Forgot

Jahmyr Gibbs scored 0 points. Zero. Gibbs was supposed to be a league-winner. Instead, he's a league-forgetter. I once forgot why I walked into a room. That was disorienting. Gibbs forgot to score points. That's worse.

Justin Jefferson: 0 points. Justin Jefferson not scoring is like a lighthouse not lighting. What's the point of the house then? Breece Hall: 0. Ja'Marr Chase: 9. CeeDee Lamb: 9. These are first-round picks, man. First round means you picked them first. Before everyone else. Because you believed in them. And they gave you single digits. Or no digits.

Brock Bowers: 0 points. The rookie tight end everyone was excited about. This week, no excitement. Kenneth Walker III: 0. Isiah Pacheco: 0. Running backs not running. That's their whole thing. Running. And they didn't do it. They just stood there. In my mind. Doing nothing.

## Looking Ahead: Week 16 Playoff Picture

Next week is the championship. Chris versus Bruce for first place. Chris is coming off a 140-point week. Bruce is coming off a loss. That's called momentum versus anti-momentum. I'm not a physics guy, but I think momentum wins. Usually. Unless it doesn't.

Dan versus Matt for third place. They both have something to prove. Or nothing to prove. Depends on how you look at it. I look at it from a couch. My perspective is horizontal.

The thing about the championship is that it matters but also doesn't matter. You play all season to get here, and then it comes down to one week. One week where Trevor Lawrence might score 48 points or 8 points. Fantasy football is random like that. It's like life. But with more spreadsheets.

## Injury Report: The Walking Wounded

**Aaron's Team:**
- Bam Knight (Injured Reserve) - Ankle. The ankle is important. It connects your foot to your leg. Without it, your foot is just a foot.
- Jayden Daniels (Out) - Elbow. Shut down for the season. Elbows are elbows, man.
- Kyler Murray (Injured Reserve) - Foot. Being treated like Russell Wilson was by the Broncos. That's not a compliment.

**Eli's Team:**
- Joe Mixon (Out) - Foot/ankle. He says he'll return. Reports say otherwise. Someone is lying.
- Patrick Mahomes (Injured Reserve) - Knee. The greatest quarterback of his generation, sitting. Watching. Probably eating snacks.

**Mike's Team:**
- Devin Neal (Out) - Hamstring. Hamstrings are deceptive. They seem fine until they're not.

**Mitch's Team:**
- Cam Skattebo (Injured Reserve) - Ankle. Another ankle. Ankles are having a rough year.
- Michael Penix Jr. (Injured Reserve) - Knee. ACL surgery. That's a long recovery. Longer than this recap.

**Pete's Team:**
- Brandon Aiyuk (Out) - Knee. On the reserve/left squad list. I don't know what that means. Left squad. Is there a right squad?
- Zach Ertz (Injured Reserve) - Knee. Another knee. Knees are also having a rough year.

## Final Thoughts

Chris leads the overall standings with 1,931 points. That's a lot of points. If points were dollars, Chris could buy a used car. Not a nice used car, but a used car that runs. Usually.

I played fantasy football for fifteen weeks. I learned that sometimes your best players score zero and sometimes Trevor Lawrence scores 48. I learned that playoffs matter more than regular weeks but feel the same. I learned that injuries happen to ankles and knees and elbows, and there's nothing you can do about it except draft someone else who might also get injured.

Fantasy football is just life with statistics. You hope for the best, prepare for the worst, and end up somewhere in the middle. Like Eli. Scoring exactly average. Being exactly okay.

Alright.

*I'm gonna go lie down now. Not because I'm tired. Just because I like being horizontal. It's the most efficient shape.*
