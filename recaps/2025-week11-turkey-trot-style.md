# THE WEEK 11 TURKEY TROT POWER RANKINGS 5K

## *"Lace Up Your Running Shoes, Fantasy Fans - This Race Just Got REAL"*

---

**RACE CONDITIONS:** Cool November air, high stakes, and twelve runners jockeying for position as the playoff finish line comes into view. The starting gun has fired, the crowd is roaring, and Week 11's Turkey Trot has delivered a performance for the ages.

Welcome, runners and spectators, to the eleventh mile marker of our grueling fantasy football marathon! As the smell of pumpkin spice and playoff desperation fills the air, we witnessed some competitors hitting their stride like seasoned Boston Marathon veterans while others cramped up harder than a first-time jogger who skipped their warm-up stretches. The lead pack is pulling away, the middle of the pack is getting chippy, and some runners are practically walking at this point, wondering if maybe pickleball was the better hobby after all.

The weather gods blessed us with some SCORCHING split times this week, topped by a performance so dominant it should require a performance-enhancing drug test. Meanwhile, others bonked so hard you'd think they'd been hydrating with nothing but eggnog since Halloween. So grab your foam rollers and your turkey sandwiches - this race report is going to leave you breathless!

## THE HEADLINER: CHRIS POSTS A COURSE RECORD

### 155.0 Points - A Pace That Defies Human Limitation

Ladies and gentlemen, Chris did not just win Week 11. Chris DESTROYED the course like a Kenyan marathoner with rocket-powered Nikes. Posting an astronomical **155.0 points**, this was the kind of performance that makes other runners consider switching to competitive hot dog eating instead.

The engine behind this runaway train? None other than **Josh Allen**, who turned in a mind-melting **48.0 fantasy points** - the kind of number that makes grown fantasy managers weep into their waiver wire claims. Allen wasn't just the lead runner in this race; he was on a motorcycle while everyone else was in wooden clogs. But wait, there's more fuel for this fantasy fire! **Dak Prescott** chipped in a casual **29.0 points** because apparently Chris is running a quarterback factory over there, and **TreVeyon Henderson** added **27.0 points** with the kind of rushing performance that would make your high school track coach tear up with pride.

What makes this even more impressive? Chris scored 155.0 points DESPITE having **Josh Jacobs, Tony Pollard, RJ Harvey, Rome Odunze, and Rashee Rice** all posting complete goose eggs (0.0 points combined). That's like winning a relay race while three of your teammates are napping at the baton exchange. Chris ran this race on three legs and still set a course record. The depth chart is questionable, but when your QB is putting up video game numbers, who cares if half your roster is on bye? Chris remains the pace setter at **10-2** with **1,488.5 total points** - so far ahead of the pack they might need to check if he started the race early.

## MATCHUP BREAKDOWNS: EVERY STRIDE, EVERY STUMBLE

### MATCHUP 1: Chris's Team (155.0) vs. Eli's Team (79.0)
**Margin of Victory: 76.0 points - THE BLOWOUT ON BYE STREET**

This wasn't a race. This was a grown adult sprinting past a toddler learning to walk. Eli showed up to the Turkey Trot, but about half his roster apparently thought the race was next week. The casualties were devastating: **Amon-Ra St. Brown** (0.0), **David Montgomery** (0.0), **Tua Tagovailoa** (0.0), **T.J. Hockenson** (0.0), **Darnell Mooney** (0.0) - we could go on, but it's getting uncomfortable, like watching someone collapse at the water station.

What little fight Eli could muster came from **Kenneth Gainwell's** respectable **22.0 points** and **Trey McBride's 17.0**, but when your quarterback depth chart of **Patrick Mahomes** only drops **14.0 points**, you're bringing a butter knife to a gunfight. Mahomes looked like a marathoner who carb-loaded with celery sticks instead of pasta. Eli falls to **5-7** and is now gasping for playoff air like a runner who sprinted the first mile way too fast.

For Chris, this was a recovery jog. A warmup. A chance to save energy for the playoff push while still demolishing the competition. The **76.0-point margin** is the kind of beating that leaves psychological scars.

---

### MATCHUP 2: Cal's Team (109.5) vs. Dan's Team (98.0)
**Margin of Victory: 11.5 points - THE FINISHING KICK**

Now THIS is what Turkey Trot drama looks like! Cal and Dan were running shoulder-to-shoulder for most of this race, both competitors gasping for air as they rounded the final turn. Cal had to dig deep into the reserves to find that final gear.

**Bijan Robinson** led Cal's charge with a powerful **25.0 points**, running through arm tackles like a runner weaving through pedestrian traffic. The **Steelers DST** added a crucial **16.0 points** - the fantasy equivalent of a runner getting a perfect drafting position behind a tall competitor to block the wind. **Trevor Lawrence** contributed **13.0 points**, looking like a runner who finally figured out proper breathing technique after ten weeks of struggling.

Dan's effort was valiant but ultimately came up short. **Kyren Williams** (14.0), **Kenneth Walker III** (11.0), **Deebo Samuel** (11.0), and **Geno Smith** (11.0) all gave solid performances - the problem was nobody exploded. It was like a relay team where everyone ran 10.5-second 100-meters: good, not great. **Saquon Barkley** only managing **6.0 points** was like your star runner getting a cramp at mile marker two. Not exactly the Week 11 you draw up for your season anchor.

Cal improves to **7-5** with this win and remains in strong playoff position. Dan slips to **5-7** and is now hanging on by a thread, which is ironically what their hamstrings probably feel like too.

---

### MATCHUP 3: Pete's Team (98.0) vs. Aaron's Team (60.0)
**Margin of Victory: 38.0 points - THE BREAKAWAY SPECIALIST**

Pete found a gear we didn't know existed, and Aaron... well, Aaron appears to have developed several stress fractures and possibly a case of heat exhaustion despite the November chill.

The star of Pete's Turkey Trot victory was an unlikely hero: **Sean Tucker**, who went absolutely NUCLEAR with **33.0 fantasy points**! Tucker ran this race like a man being chased by an angry turkey - desperate, powerful, and impossible to catch. Add in **Travis Kelce's 14.0 points** (the veteran marathoner still has some miles left in those legs), **Nico Collins' 14.0**, **Jared Goff's 14.0**, and **Matthew Stafford's 10.0**, and you have a well-balanced squad firing on all cylinders.

Aaron, meanwhile, experienced the worst kind of race day: your body just gives out. **Zach Charbonnet** (0.0), **Tank Bigsby** (0.0), and the **Cardinals DST** (0.0) all no-showed like runners who slept through their alarms. Only **Tetairoa McMillan** (25.0) remembered to set his, but one runner can't carry a relay team. Aaron's **2-10** record is now the fantasy equivalent of someone who signed up for a marathon but has been walking the whole thing. The playoff dream is officially dead, but at least they're still technically in the race?

Both teams now sit at **6-6**, though Pete has the vastly superior points total. The tiebreaker implications are REAL, people!

### MATCHUP 4: Matt's Team (94.0) vs. Bruce's Team (67.5)
**Margin of Victory: 26.5 points - THE SECOND WIND**

Last week, Matt's team looked like a runner who forgot their shoes and had to run barefoot on gravel, posting a miserable 49.5 points in Week 10. This week? Matt found those shoes, broke them in during warmups, and put on a SHOW.

The resurrection was led by **Bryce Young** - yes, THAT Bryce Young - who erupted for **32.0 fantasy points** like a runner everyone counted out suddenly channeling their inner Usain Bolt. **Christian McCaffrey** added **30.0 points** upon his return, running with the fresh legs of someone who's been on injured reserve relaxing while everyone else has been grinding. **Derrick Henry's 17.0 points** was the cherry on top of this comeback sundae.

Bruce, meanwhile, stumbled through this race like someone who overdid it at the pre-race pasta dinner. **Ja'Marr Chase** (0.0), **DK Metcalf** (0.0), **Calvin Ridley** (0.0), **Jerry Jeudy** (0.0), **Nick Chubb** (0.0), and the **Texans DST** (0.0) - that's SIX ZEROES on your roster! **Drake Maye** tried his best with **14.0 points**, and **Bhayshul Tuten** added **11.0**, but this was like showing up to a group run and realizing five of your friends are still in bed.

Matt rockets to **8-4** and clinches a playoff-caliber position. Bruce falls to **.500** at **6-6**, officially entering "must-win territory" for the home stretch.

---

### MATCHUP 5: Mitch's Team (93.0) vs. Sean's Team (76.0)
**Margin of Victory: 17.0 points - THE STEADY PACE**

Mitch ran the smart race here - no heroics, no risks, just solid fundamentals and letting the competition make mistakes. And boy, did Sean make some mistakes (or at least, Sean's players did).

**Brock Purdy** (21.0) and **George Kittle** (19.0) provided the 49ers stack that finally produced, like a running duo who've been training together all year finally syncing their paces. **Xavier Legette's 14.0 points** and **Kareem Hunt's 11.0** rounded out a workmanlike performance. Not flashy, but effective - like a runner in a neon vest and sensible shoes who passes you while you're doubled over with a side stitch.

Sean's woes continued with a disappointing performance from **Justin Jefferson**, who managed only **3.0 points** despite being drafted as a top-tier talent. That's like your elite marathon runner stopping to tie their shoes for two miles. **Breece Hall** also underperformed with **3.0 points**, and the **Justin Herbert** goose egg (0.0) didn't help. **Travis Etienne Jr.** (19.0) and **Devin Singletary** (16.0) tried to carry the load, but when your receivers are jogging, you can't expect to win races.

Mitch climbs to **5-7**, still on life support but breathing. Sean drops to **3-9** and is now officially in "running for next year's draft position" territory.

---

### MATCHUP 6: Joe's Team (91.0) vs. Mike's Team (65.5)
**Margin of Victory: 25.5 points - THE VETERAN CRUISER**

Joe continues to run this marathon like a seasoned veteran who knows exactly when to conserve energy and when to push. Week 11 was a push week, and Mike didn't have the conditioning to respond.

**Jacoby Brissett** of all people led the charge with **25.0 fantasy points** - the journeyman quarterback running like he found a shortcut through the woods. **George Pickens** added **17.0 points** doing George Pickens things, and **Justin Fields** contributed **16.0** as Joe's QB depth continues to pay dividends. **James Cook** (11.0) and **Jordan Mason** (8.0) kept the legs churning on the ground.

Mike, meanwhile, watched several key players pull up lame. **Jacory Croskey-Merritt** (0.0), **Tyjae Spears** (0.0), and **Mason Taylor** (0.0) all whiffed, while the **Packers** and **Bills DSTs** combined for a stunning **0.0 points**. That's two defenses and three offensive players giving you NOTHING. **Baker Mayfield** (13.0), **Jordan Love** (12.0), and **Tee Higgins** (11.0) did their jobs, but you can't run a race with half your team on the injured bench.

Joe solidifies their position at **10-2** with a league-best **1,479.5 points**, just behind Chris in the rankings. Mike falls to **5-7** and needs a strong finish to stay in playoff contention.

## PERFORMANCE TIER ANALYSIS: THE PACK SEPARATES

### THE FRONTRUNNERS (100+ Points) - Elite Pace
| Runner | Split Time | Race Pace |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Chris's Team | 155.0 | 10-2 (1,488.5 PF) |
| Cal's Team | 109.5 | 7-5 (1,275.5 PF) |

These runners are in their own heat. Chris is practically running a different race at this point, while Cal showed they belong with the big dogs. Both teams are cruising toward the playoff finish line with extra water in their bottles and energy gels to spare.

### THE COMPETITIVE PACK (90-100 Points) - Solid Stride
| Runner | Split Time | Race Pace |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Pete's Team | 98.0 | 6-6 (1,046.5 PF) |
| Dan's Team | 98.0 | 5-7 (1,050.5 PF) |
| Matt's Team | 94.0 | 8-4 (1,065.5 PF) |
| Mitch's Team | 93.0 | 5-7 (945.5 PF) |
| Joe's Team | 91.0 | 10-2 (1,479.5 PF) |

Five teams bunched together like runners drafting off each other at mile eight. Joe's relatively "low" score of 91.0 (still above league average!) shows they don't need to dominate every week - they just need to be better than their opponent. Matt's resurgence is the story here, going from 49.5 to 94.0 points in one week - that's called finding your second wind!

### THE STRAGGLERS (65-80 Points) - Cramping Up
| Runner | Split Time | Race Pace |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Eli's Team | 79.0 | 5-7 (968.0 PF) |
| Sean's Team | 76.0 | 3-9 (1,099.0 PF) |
| Bruce's Team | 67.5 | 6-6 (1,137.5 PF) |
| Mike's Team | 65.5 | 5-7 (1,053.5 PF) |

These runners are struggling. Whether it's bye weeks, underperformance, or just bad luck, this group needs to find another gear FAST. Bruce's zero-heavy roster and Sean's star player failures are the kinds of race-day disasters you can't recover from.

### THE BONKERS (Under 65 Points) - Hit The Wall
| Runner | Split Time | Race Pace |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Aaron's Team | 60.0 | 2-10 (940.0 PF) |

Aaron has officially bonked. Hit the wall. Run out of glycogen. Whatever marathon metaphor you prefer for "this season is over." At 2-10, the only race left is against the clock, and even that feels like a losing battle.

## THE BUST BRIGADE: CRAMPED UP AT THE STARTING LINE

When studs become duds, fantasy hearts break harder than a runner's will at mile 24. This week's Bust Brigade features some SHOCKING no-shows:

**The Goose Egg Gang (0.0 Points - Active Roster):**
- **Ja'Marr Chase** (Bruce) - The elite receiver couldn't even post a single point. Like a thoroughbred racehorse who refuses to leave the starting gate.
- **Amon-Ra St. Brown** (Eli) - Detroit's reception machine was apparently in power-saving mode.
- **Saquon Barkley** (Dan) - Posted just 6.0 points, which might as well be a zero for a first-round pick.
- **Lamar Jackson** (Mitch) - Only 6.0 points from the MVP candidate. He was running like someone swapped his Gatorade for warm milk.
- **Justin Jefferson** (Sean) - 3.0 points. THREE. Like showing up to run a 5K and walking the whole thing.
- **Breece Hall** (Sean) - Also 3.0 points. When your RB1 and WR1 combine for 6 points, you're not finishing this race.

---

## CLOSE CALLS AND HEARTBREAKS: PHOTO FINISHES

The **Cal vs. Dan** matchup was the thriller of the week, separated by just **11.5 points**. Dan could taste victory the entire fourth quarter, only to watch Cal find an extra gear and pull away. If Saquon Barkley had remembered he's supposed to be elite, this would have gone the other way. If Davante Adams (8.0 points) had found the end zone just once, Dan takes this race. Instead, Cal celebrates while Dan does the lonely walk back to their car wondering what could have been.

The **Mitch vs. Sean** battle (17.0 point margin) was closer than it looked on paper - Sean was still in this thing deep into Sunday afternoon before the Kittle-Purdy stack pulled away. Heartbreaking for a team at 3-9, but at this point, Sean's just running out the clock on a disappointing season.

---

## LOOKING AHEAD: THE FINAL SPRINT

With only a few weeks remaining before the playoff gates close, here's where we stand:

**LOCKED IN (Playoff-bound):**
- **Chris's Team (10-2)** and **Joe's Team (10-2)** are essentially fighting for the #1 seed. Both have separated from the pack and are running their own race now.
- **Matt's Team (8-4)** is in fantastic position after their Week 11 explosion.

**FIGHTING FOR POSITION (Playoff bubble):**
- **Cal's Team (7-5)** needs one or two more wins to feel safe.
- **Bruce's Team (6-6)** and **Pete's Team (6-6)** are dead even at .500 and sweating bullets.

**LIFE SUPPORT (Need help):**
- **Dan's Team (5-7)**, **Eli's Team (5-7)**, **Mike's Team (5-7)**, and **Mitch's Team (5-7)** - FOUR teams at 5-7! This is a traffic jam at the finish line!

**MATHEMATICALLY ALIVE BUT SPIRITUALLY DEFEATED:**
- **Sean's Team (3-9)** and **Aaron's Team (2-10)** - Start training for next year's race, boys.

*This Turkey Trot has been absolutely RIVETING, folks! The front-runners are pulling away, the middle of the pack is a chaotic mess of elbows and determination, and the stragglers are just hoping to cross the finish line before the volunteers start packing up the water stations. Next week promises more drama, more heartbreak, and hopefully more turkey-fueled fantasy performances!*

*Until then, keep those legs fresh and those waiver claims sharp!*

**HAPPY THANKSGIVING, FANTASY RUNNERS!**
