# WEEK 15 FANTASY FOOTBALL RECAP: THE EDDIE MURPHY EXPERIENCE

*[Steps out in red leather suit, adjusts microphone]*

## HELLO, HELLO, HELLO! WELCOME TO THE SHOW!

*[High-pitched laugh]* Heh-heh-heh-heh!

Ladies and gentlemen, BOYS AND GIRLS, children of ALL ages - welcome to Week 15 of fantasy football, where dreams come true and other dreams get CRUSHED like my aunt Bunny sitting on a folding chair! *[Does impression of chair collapsing]* WAHHHHH! 

Now I'm gonna tell you something, and I want you to listen to me VERY carefully. This week... THIS WEEK... we saw some things that would make your mama slap you twice and say "Boy, what is WRONG with you?!" We got Cal over here putting up 174 points like he's been eating his Wheaties with some kind of SPECIAL sauce! Meanwhile, Mike's team is sitting there with 74.5 points looking like my uncle Vernon when he found out they discontinued his favorite lottery ticket. That's a HUNDRED POINT difference, people! A HUNDRED POINTS! *[Screams]* 

You know what that is? That's like showing up to a party in a LIMOUSINE while everyone else took the BUS! And not the nice bus neither - I'm talking about the bus with the ONE working wheel and the driver who keeps falling asleep! *[Does impression of sleepy bus driver jerking awake]*

## THE HEADLINER: CAL AND THE JACKSONVILLE MIRACLE

*[Walks across stage dramatically]*

Now let me tell you about Cal. This man... THIS MAN... had Trevor Lawrence put up FORTY-EIGHT POINTS! FORTY-EIGHT! *[Voice cracks]* You know what that is? That's like your cousin Theo saying he's gonna pay you back and then he ACTUALLY DOES! Nobody expected it! Trevor Lawrence, the man with the beautiful hair and the beautiful arm, decided Week 15 was HIS week to shine brighter than my leather pants under these stage lights!

But wait, there's MORE! *[Does Gomer Pyle impression]* SURPRISE, SURPRISE, SURPRISE! Kyle Pitts - and I KNOW y'all forgot about Kyle Pitts, everybody forgot about Kyle Pitts, Kyle Pitts' MAMA forgot about Kyle Pitts - this man put up THIRTY-SIX POINTS! That tight end position that's been deader than disco suddenly came ALIVE like it was weekend at Bernie's but Bernie actually WOKE UP! *[Does zombie impression]*

Cal had Bijan Robinson with 20 points, Tyrone Tracy Jr. with 19, Caleb Williams with 16, and Jason Myers kicking in 12 points. This man had FIVE players in double digits! FIVE! That's more fingers than my uncle Gus has on his left hand after that incident at the factory we don't talk about!

## THE PLAYOFF PICTURE: CHRIS DEFEATS DAN IN THE SEMIFINALS

*[Gets serious for a moment, then bursts out laughing]*

Okay, okay, okay. Let's talk about what REALLY matters here. The playoffs, baby! And in the battle for advancement to the CHAMPIONSHIP, we had Chris going up against Dan in what can only be described as a... *[dramatic pause]* MURDER!

Chris put up 140.0 points - that's ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY - while Dan managed 124.5. Now 124.5 ain't BAD, you understand what I'm saying? If this was any other week, Dan would be walking around like he's somebody! But THIS week? Against CHRIS? *[Makes explosion sound]* 

Let me break down what happened to Chris's team because it was BEAUTIFUL. TreVeyon Henderson - and yes I said that right, TreVeyon with a SILENT "Y" that makes no SENSE but that's America, baby - this rookie running back put up 25 points! Then you got Josh Allen with 21 points doing Josh Allen things, which is basically being a human TANK with a cannon for an arm. Josh Jacobs added 19, Tony Pollard threw in 17, Jameson Williams contributed 17 more... this man was STACKED!

And poor Dan... POOR DAN... had Kyren Williams with 22 points leading the charge, but you know who DIDN'T show up? Kenneth Walker III with a big fat ZERO! Deebo Samuel? ZERO! Raheem Mostert? ZERO! That's three players who decided to take Week 15 OFF like it was a vacation day! You can't win games when your players are at HOME watching JEOPARDY! *[Does impression of Alex Trebek]* "The answer is: What is ZERO POINTS, Dan!"

---

## MATT OVER BRUCE: THE OTHER SEMIFINAL SHOWDOWN

*[Changes voice to dramatic announcer]*

AND IN THE OTHER CORNER...

Matt came into this game against Bruce with something to PROVE, and prove it he DID! Final score: Matt 108.0, Bruce 91.0. Now Bruce, bless his heart, had Bo Nix leading his team with 29 points. Bo Nix looked GREAT! He looked like a STAR! But you know what they say about stars? THEY EXPLODE! *[Makes explosion sound again]* 

Actually, Bo Nix was fine. It was EVERYONE ELSE on Bruce's team that exploded. Brock Bowers - the ROOKIE sensation, the man everyone DRAFTED early - put up a big old GOOSE EGG! ZERO! Jerry Jeudy? ZERO! That's your star tight end and your receiver sitting at home eating CHIPS while Matt's team was out there WORKING!

Matt had J.J. McCarthy throw up 27 points - and yes, the Vikings rookie is OUT HERE making plays - C.J. Stroud added 24, DJ Moore contributed 19... even Christian McCaffrey managed 11 points, which is amazing considering that man has been held together with TAPE and PRAYERS all season! *[Does impression of trainer wrapping CMC]* "Hold still Mr. McCaffrey, we just need fourteen more rolls of athletic tape..."

## THE CHAMPIONSHIP PREVIEW: CHRIS VS MATT FOR ALL THE MARBLES

*[Gets low, speaks in hushed tone]*

Now listen here... LISTEN HERE... this is IMPORTANT.

Next week, Week 16, we got Chris facing Matt for the CHAMPIONSHIP! *[Voice rises]* THE CHAMPIONSHIP! This is what it's ALL been about! Chris has been the number one team ALL SEASON with 1,769.5 total scoring points - almost 300 points ahead of SECOND PLACE! This man has been DOMINANT like my uncle Jerome at the all-you-can-eat buffet!

But Matt... Matt is DANGEROUS. He's got CMC, he's got Derrick Henry, he's got A.J. Brown when that man decides to SHOW UP. This is gonna be a FIGHT, baby! This is gonna be like Ali versus Frazier, but with more spreadsheets and less punching!

And for third place? Dan versus Bruce! The battle of the ALMOST champions! It's like fighting for the bronze medal - nobody WANTS it but somebody's GETTING it! *[Laughs]* Heh-heh-heh!

## THE BUST BRIGADE: PLAYERS WHO SHOULD BE ASHAMED

*[Puts hands on hips, shakes head]*

Now we gotta talk about the players who let their owners DOWN this week, because some of these performances were CRIMINAL. I'm talking about putting these players under CITIZEN'S ARREST for fantasy fraud!

Mitch's team had EIGHT PLAYERS score ZERO points! EIGHT! Chuba Hubbard? ZERO! Brian Robinson Jr.? ZERO! Cooper Kupp? ZERO! Stefon Diggs? ZERO! Kareem Hunt? ZERO! Keenan Allen? ZERO! Xavier Legette? ZERO! Samaje Perine? ZERO! That's like showing up to work and doing NOTHING but somehow still getting FIRED because at least if you were sleeping they could SAY you were there!

Mike had Jahmyr Gibbs put up ZERO despite being one of the best running backs in football! Romeo Doubs? ZERO! Daniel Carlson, his KICKER? ZERO! A kicker scoring zero is like a FISH not being able to SWIM! That's your ONE JOB!

And Sean - oh, SEAN - had Justin Jefferson with ZERO! Breece Hall with ZERO! Jaylen Waddle with ZERO! That's supposed to be your STARS, man! That's like hiring the Beatles and only RINGO shows up! *[Does Ringo impression drumming alone]*

## THE TIERS OF DESTINY

*[Walks to different part of stage]*

Let me break this down for you in terms even my cousin Ray-Ray could understand, and that man thinks a calculator is a phone that does math.

**THE ELITE TIER - The Penthouse Suite:**
- Cal: 174.0 points (RIDICULOUS)
- Chris: 140.0 points (Championship bound!)

**THE COMPETITIVE TIER - The Nice Apartment:**
- Pete: 130.0 points
- Dan: 124.5 points
- Eli: 117.0 points
- Matt: 108.0 points

**THE STRUGGLING TIER - The Studio with Roommates:**
- Bruce: 91.0 points
- Aaron: 81.0 points
- Sean: 76.0 points
- Mitch: 77.0 points
- Mike: 74.5 points

The gap between Cal at the top and Mike at the bottom is almost 100 points! That's not a gap, that's a CANYON! That's the Grand Canyon but instead of being filled with history and beauty, it's filled with DISAPPOINTMENT and MISSED WAIVER PICKS!

---

## THE NON-PLAYOFF TEAMS: EVERYONE ELSE'S PAIN

*[Sighs dramatically]*

Now for the teams that ain't playing for nothing but PRIDE, and let me tell you, pride don't pay no BILLS!

Joe put up 133.0 raw points, second in the league this week behind Cal, but he's not in the playoffs so it's like being the BEST singer at KARAOKE - sure, you sound good, but you ain't getting no RECORD DEAL! James Cook III led his team with 33 points, looking like the James Cook we all HOPED he'd be! Jalen Hurts and Jacoby Brissett both had 21, Dallas Goedert contributed 19... this team would have DESTROYED people in the playoffs but NOOOOOO, Joe had to lose earlier in the season!

Pete managed 130.0 points with Jared Goff's 27 leading the way, followed by Nico Collins and D'Andre Swift both at 22. Matthew Stafford also had 22! That's FOUR players over 20 points! But Pete ain't in the playoffs neither! It's like having a LAMBORGHINI but no driver's license!

Eli dropped 117.0 points on nobody that matters, with Amon-Ra St. Brown's 28 and Trey McBride's 25 leading the charge. This man is DANGEROUS but the season is OVER for him! *[Pretends to cry]*

---

## LOOKING AHEAD: THE PROPHECY

*[Gets mystical, waves hands]*

I'm gonna make a PREDICTION, and I want you to write this DOWN! 

Week 16 is gonna be CHAOS! Chris has been the best team all year, but Matt has the STAR POWER! You got CMC, Derrick Henry, A.J. Brown - these are NAMES! These are players you see on COMMERCIALS! Chris has Josh Allen and depth, but does depth beat STAR POWER?

*[Does impression of old fortune teller]* I see... I see... POINTS! Many points! The winner will score over 130 points! Maybe 140! And the loser? The loser will wonder where it all went WRONG, like my cousin when he bet his car on a horse named "Sure Thing" that came in LAST!

For the third place game, Dan's gonna need his team to WAKE UP! Kenneth Walker, Deebo Samuel - these men need to PLAY! Bruce needs... well, Bruce needs a MIRACLE, but miracles happen, baby! That's why they call 'em MIRACLES!

## THE INJURY REPORT: CASUALTIES OF WAR

*[Gets somber, bows head]*

A moment of silence for the fallen...

| Player | Team | Position | Status | Fantasy Team |
|--------|------|----------|--------|--------------|
| Bam Knight | ARI | RB | Injured Reserve (ankle) | Aaron |
| Jayden Daniels | WSH | QB | Out (shut down for season) | Aaron |
| Kyler Murray | ARI | QB | Injured Reserve (foot) | Aaron |
| Joe Mixon | HOU | RB | Out (foot/ankle) | Eli |
| Patrick Mahomes | KC | QB | Injured Reserve (knee) | Eli |
| Devin Neal | NO | RB | Out (hamstring) | Mike |
| Cam Skattebo | NYG | RB | Injured Reserve (ankle) | Mitch |
| Michael Penix Jr. | ATL | QB | Injured Reserve (ACL) | Mitch |
| Brandon Aiyuk | SF | WR | Out (knee) | Pete |
| Zach Ertz | WSH | TE | Injured Reserve (knee) | Pete |

Look at Aaron's team! THREE players on injured reserve or out! That's not a fantasy team, that's a HOSPITAL WARD! And Patrick Mahomes going down? That's like losing the ENGINE of your car! You can still push it, but you ain't going NOWHERE fast!

## THE FINAL WORD

*[Returns to center stage, spotlight tightens]*

Listen, I want to tell you something REAL for a second. This has been a BEAUTIFUL season of fantasy football. We've laughed, we've cried, we've yelled at our phones when our players fumble on the goal line. We've stayed up late watching Sunday Night Football for a KICKER to get us four more points. We've checked the injury report more than we've checked on our OWN health!

But that's what makes this BEAUTIFUL, man! That's what makes this FAMILY!

So congratulations to Chris and Matt for making the championship! Good luck to Dan and Bruce in the third place game! And to everyone else... *[Starts laughing]* ...there's always NEXT YEAR! Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!

*[Walks off stage, leather pants squeaking]*

I'M OUT!
