[THEME MUSIC PLAYS]

**[Walks out to center stage, straightens tie, waves to audience]**

Thank you, thank you! Please, sit down! Wow, what a crowd! What a crowd! Hey, so great to be here with you tonight, folks. Great to be here. 

[Adjusts jacket]

So, Week 7 of fantasy football just wrapped up, and let me tell you... [pauses for effect] ...it was uglier than my first marriage! [rimshot] No, but seriously folks, we had scores this week that were lower than my credit rating in the '90s! 

[Audience laughs]

But first, let's talk about the BIG story of the week. Mike's Team - Mike, ladies and gentlemen - scored 134 points! ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FOUR! [Audience applauds] That's more points than I scored on my SATs! [rimshot] And Cal's Team? Cal scored 85 points. EIGHTY-FIVE! That's a 49-point beatdown! Folks, that's not a football game, that's elder abuse! [Audience groans and laughs] I haven't seen someone get beaten that badly since... well, since Mitch played this week! We'll get to him later!

[Walks to other side of stage]

But seriously, Mike had TWO running backs score 30-plus points. Jahmyr Gibbs with 31, Quinshon Judkins with 30. TWO THIRTY-POINT RUNNING BACKS! You know what I call that? [pause] Tuesday at Mike's house! [rimshot] Meanwhile, poor Cal - and I mean POOR Cal - started Caleb Williams at quarterback. Caleb Williams scored... wait for it... ZERO POINTS! [Audience gasps] ZERO! Zip! Nada! Goose egg! That's fewer points than the number of times I've been invited back to host the Oscars! [Self-deprecating shrug]

## Top 10 Things Cal Said After Scoring 85 Points

[GRAPHIC APPEARS ON SCREEN]

Number 10: "At least I beat Mitch!"
Number 9: "Is it too late to switch to cricket?"
Number 8: "I've seen better performances at a middle school talent show!"
Number 7: "Maybe I should have started my grandmother at QB!"
Number 6: "Do they make fantasy football participation trophies?"
Number 5: "I scored more points in my driver's test!"
Number 4: "Next week, I'm starting the waterboy!"
Number 3: "Even my therapist can't help me now!"
Number 2: "I'm changing my team name to 'The Walking Dead!'"

And the Number 1 thing Cal said after scoring 85 points...

"At least Aaron is still winless!" [HUGE AUDIENCE REACTION]

[Band plays sting]

## The Championship Chase: Chris vs. Dan

Now folks, let's talk about the match of the week that actually mattered! Chris's Team versus Dan's Team - both sitting pretty at 5-1, fighting for that top spot like two people fighting over the last piece of shrimp at a Vegas buffet! 

[Mimics boxing stance]

In this corner, weighing in at 128.5 points, Chris "The Commish" with his Team! [Audience cheers] And in this corner, at 116.5 points, Dan "So Close Yet So Far" with his squad! [Mixed reaction]

Chris came out SWINGING with Dak Prescott throwing for 24 points! Twenty-four! That's more completions than I've had successful relationships! [rimshot] But here's the thing - and this is true - Chris also started Josh Allen who scored... anybody? Anybody want to guess? ZERO POINTS! [Audience groans] Josh Allen! The Buffalo Bills quarterback! Zero! That's like ordering a steak and getting tofu! It's like buying a Ferrari and getting a tricycle! It's like... it's like starting Josh Allen in Week 7!

[Walks across stage]

But Dan - oh, Dan tried to fight back! He had THREE quarterbacks combine for 77 points! Jalen Hurts with 27, Aaron Rodgers with 26 - wait, Aaron Rodgers is on PITTSBURGH now? [Confused look] When did THAT happen? Did I miss a memo? Is this the Twilight Zone? [Looks at cards] Oh, that's right, this IS 2025 fantasy football where nothing makes sense and the points don't matter! Just like my diet plan!

Dan also had Davante Adams putting up 24 points. Davante Adams! Remember when he was on the Raiders? Then the Jets? Now he's on the Rams? This guy changes teams more than I change underwear! [Pause] That's daily, by the way. DAILY! [Audience laughs]

## The Mitch Disaster Hour

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

Folks, we need to talk about Mitch's Team. [Shakes head solemnly] Mitch scored... 59.5 points. FIFTY-NINE POINT FIVE! [Audience gasps] That's not a fantasy score, that's a bowling score! And not even a good bowling score! That's like three frames and then you hurt your back!

[Pulls out cards dramatically]

Pete's Team beat Mitch 95.5 to 59.5. That's a 36-point margin! Thirty-six points! The last time I saw a gap that wide was between my teeth before I got veneers! [Points to teeth, smiles]

You know what's sad? Pete only scored 95.5 points and STILL destroyed Mitch! Pete had Matthew Stafford throw for 31 points, which is nice, but the rest of his team? [Makes "meh" gesture] Brandon Aiyuk? OUT! Other players? Mediocre! But against Mitch's 59.5? Pete looked like the '85 Bears!

[Serious face]

Mitch, buddy, if you're watching... and I know you're not because you've probably thrown your TV out the window... but Mitch, it gets better! No wait, actually for you it doesn't. You're 3-4. Never mind! [Audience laughs]

---

## The Joe Show Continues

[Upbeat music]

Now let's talk about someone who's actually GOOD at this! Joe's Team, ladies and gentlemen! [Applause] Joe is now 6-1! SIX AND ONE! This guy's so good at fantasy football, he's being investigated by Congress! [rimshot]

Joe beat Eli 99.5 to 93 by only 6.5 points, but a win is a win! Joe had Jonathan Taylor rush for 30 points! THIRTY! You know what Jonathan Taylor said after the game? "I'm on Joe's team, of course I scored 30!" It's like being on the Warriors with Steph Curry - you just know you're going to win!

But Eli - poor Eli at 4-3 now - Eli actually played well! Patrick Mahomes with 24 points! Trey McBride with 19! But here's the problem - Joe Mixon was OUT! You can't win in fantasy football with Joe Mixon out! That's like trying to do this show without cue cards - it's technically possible but nobody wants to see it!

---

## The Battle of the Basement

[Sad trombone]

Speaking of nobody wanting to see it... let's talk about Aaron's Team versus Bruce's Team! [Audience "awwwwws"]

Aaron - and folks, this is not a joke - Aaron is now 0-7. ZERO AND SEVEN! [Audience gasps] The last time I saw someone this winless, it was... well, it was me trying to get a date in high school! [Self-deprecating laugh]

Bruce beat Aaron 118 to 96.5. Bruce had Bo Nix - BO NIX! - throw for 39 points! THIRTY-NINE! That's the highest score of the week! Bo Nix! I don't even know who Bo Nix is! Is that a real person or did Bruce just make up a name? [Looks at audience] Bo Nix sounds like a breakfast cereal! "Hey kids, try new Bo Nix! Part of this complete fantasy domination!"

[Gets serious]

But Aaron... Aaron, Aaron, Aaron. Started Kyler Murray - OUT! Jakobi Meyers - OUT! This guy had more injuries than a season of Grey's Anatomy! His bench looked like a hospital ward! At this point, Aaron's not managing a fantasy team, he's running a medical clinic!

And get this - Aaron had Jaxson Dart score 32 points! THIRTY-TWO! That's fantastic! But when you start two quarterbacks and one scores zero? That's like having a two-car garage with a Ferrari and a shopping cart!

---

## Sean vs. Matt: The Mediocre Bowl

[Playful music]

Sean's Team lost to Matt's Team 112 to 117. Both teams are 2-5, fighting for... well, fighting for the right to not be last! It's like two people arguing over who gets the middle seat on an airplane - nobody really wins!

Matt had Christian McCaffrey finally show up with 28 points! CMC! Remember when he was the first overall pick in every draft? Now he's just trying to keep Matt from complete embarrassment! Matt also had A.J. Brown with 25 and DeVonta Smith with 20 - that's 45 points from Eagles receivers! Fly Eagles Fly! More like "Fly Matt's team to mediocrity!"

Sean had Justin Herbert and Joe Flacco combine for 57 points at QB! Joe Flacco! JOE FLACCO IS STILL PLAYING? [Looks shocked] What year is this? Is Joe Flacco immortal? Does he have a portrait in his attic that's aging? Someone check on this!

But here's the kicker - literally - Sean had Kendre Miller, who just got placed on IR! INJURED RESERVE! During the game! That's like your date leaving halfway through dinner! "Sorry Sean, I'm going on Injured Reserve. It's not you, it's my knee!"

## Top 10 Signs Your Fantasy Team Is In Trouble

[GRAPHIC APPEARS]

Number 10: Your highest scorer is your kicker
Number 9: You're starting players you've never heard of
Number 8: Your quarterback is "questionable" and so is your life
Number 7: You're 0-7 like Aaron
Number 6: Your team scored fewer points than a soccer game
Number 5: You're googling "Can I start myself at running back?"
Number 4: Your bench outscored your starters
Number 3: You're considering starting Tim Tebow
Number 2: Even Mitch feels bad for you

And the Number 1 sign your fantasy team is in trouble...

You're seriously considering fantasy hockey! [Band sting]

## The Injury Report: Walking Wounded

[Somber music]

Now folks, let's take a moment of silence for the injured. [Removes hat dramatically]

- Mike Evans - BROKEN COLLARBONE! That's not an injury, that's a season ender!
- Brandon Aiyuk - Still out with knee! 
- Puka Nacua - Ghost protocol!
- Brock Bowers - Knee problems!
- Joe Mixon - Foot/ankle combo meal of pain!
- Kendre Miller - IR'd mid-game like a surprise plot twist!

[Puts hat back on]

You know what this injury list looks like? The cast of a medical drama! "Next week on General Hospital..."

## Looking Ahead: The Playoff Picture

[Upbeat finale music]

So where do we stand after Week 7? 

Joe and Chris are 6-1, sitting pretty at the top like two kids who actually studied for the test! Matt's at 5-2, trying to prove he belongs with the cool kids. 

Then we have the 4-3 crew - Cal, Bruce, and Eli - all thinking "Hey, we still have a chance!" That's like me thinking I still have a chance with Jennifer Aniston - technically possible but probably not happening!

The 3-4 gang - Pete, Dan, and Mitch - they're on life support but still breathing! Like my career in the '90s!

The 2-5 duo of Mike and Sean - mathematically alive but spiritually defeated!

And then... there's Aaron. Oh, Aaron. 0-7. The only thing Aaron's winning this year is the first draft pick next season! [Audience laughs]

## Final Thoughts

[Walks to center stage]

You know what I love about fantasy football? It makes grown adults cry over pretend teams with real money! [Audience laughs] It's like the stock market but with more swearing!

This week we saw Mike drop 134 points, Mitch scrape together 59.5, and Aaron continue his historic winless streak. We saw injuries, disasters, and Bo Nix become a superhero! 

We saw Chris maintain his grip on first place despite starting a quarterback who scored ZERO POINTS! That's like winning a race with a flat tire! 

We saw Bruce get his fourth win with a quarterback named Bo Nix! BO NIX! I'm still not convinced that's a real person!

And we saw Mitch... poor, poor Mitch... score fewer points than I have hair follicles! [Points to balding head, audience laughs]

---

[Music swells]

That's our show for tonight folks! Remember, in fantasy football, like in life, it doesn't matter if you win or lose... wait, no, that's wrong. It TOTALLY matters if you win or lose! Ask Aaron! He'll tell you! From his therapist's couch!

We'll see you next week when someone scores 40 points, someone else scores 140, and Aaron goes 0-8! 

Good night everybody! Keep those lineups optimized and your expectations low! We'll be right back after this commercial break that's somehow less painful than watching Mitch's team!

[WAVES TO AUDIENCE AS BAND PLAYS]

**Post-Credits Scene:**

"Hey, did you hear Aaron's considering picking up Johnny Manziel?"
"From what league?"
"The XFL!"
"...Is that still a thing?"
"For Aaron? Everything's still a thing!"

[FINAL RIMSHOT]
