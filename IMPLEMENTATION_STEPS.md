# Fantasy Football App Implementation Steps

## Overview
This document outlines the sequential steps to build a single-league fantasy football management application with a read-only public interface and admin roster management capabilities.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

### Step 1: Project Setup and Dependencies
- Create the project directory structure
- Initialize npm and create package.json
- Install required dependencies:
  - express (web server)
  - better-sqlite3 (database)
  - axios (HTTP requests for API)
  - node-cron (scheduled tasks)
  - dotenv (environment variables)
  - cors (cross-origin requests)
- Set up .env file with API keys and configuration
- Create .gitignore file

### Step 2: Database Design and Implementation
- Create SQLite database schema file
- Design tables for:
  - League settings (single league configuration)
  - Teams (12 teams with owner names)
  - NFL players (synced from API)
  - Fantasy rosters (which players belong to which teams)
  - Player stats (weekly performance data)
  - Matchups (weekly head-to-head games)
  - Scoring rules (PPR scoring system)
- Create database connection module
- Implement database initialization script

### Step 3: Express Server Setup
- Create main server file (app.js)
- Configure Express middleware
- Set up static file serving for public pages
- Create basic route structure
- Implement error handling
- Add graceful shutdown handling

### Step 4: Tank01 API Integration
- Create Tank01 service class
- Implement methods for:
  - Fetching NFL player list
  - Getting weekly player stats
  - Retrieving NFL schedule
  - Getting live scores
- Add error handling and rate limiting
- Create response data parsing logic

### Step 5: Player Data Synchronization
- Build player sync service
- Implement initial player roster import
- Create weekly stats update logic
- Add fantasy point calculations
- Set up data validation and error handling
- Filter for fantasy-relevant positions only

### Step 6: League Initialization
- Create script to initialize league
- Add 12 teams with owner names
- Set league configuration (PPR, roster size, etc.)
- Initialize scoring rules
- Generate season schedule

## Phase 2: Core Features

### Step 7: Roster Management System
- Create team routes and endpoints
- Implement roster viewing functionality
- Build admin-only roster modification endpoints
- Add player add/drop functionality
- Implement roster position management (starters vs bench)
- Add roster validation rules

### Step 8: Scoring System Implementation
- Create scoring service
- Implement PPR scoring calculations
- Build team score aggregation
- Add weekly score updates
- Create historical score tracking

### Step 9: Matchup and Schedule Management
- Build schedule generation algorithm (round-robin)
- Create matchup routes and endpoints
- Implement weekly matchup views
- Add score tracking for matchups
- Build win/loss record management

### Step 10: Automated Stats Updates
- Set up node-cron scheduler
- Configure update times:
  - Daily player sync (3 AM)
  - Game-time updates (every 15 min during games)
  - Primetime game updates (Monday/Thursday nights)
- Implement stats fetching and processing
- Add automatic score calculations
- Update matchup results

### Step 11: Public Frontend Development
- Create main landing page
- Build standings page
- Develop matchups view
- Add team detail pages
- Implement responsive design
- Create auto-refresh functionality

### Step 12: Admin Interface
- Build admin authentication
- Create roster management interface
- Add player search and filtering
- Implement drag-and-drop roster updates
- Add bulk operations support
- Create admin activity logging

## Phase 3: Enhancement Features

### Step 13: Real-time Updates (Optional)
- Add Socket.io for WebSocket support
- Implement live score broadcasting
- Create real-time standings updates
- Add push notifications for scoring plays
- Build connection management

### Step 14: Advanced Analytics
- Create player performance trends
- Build team analytics dashboard
- Add head-to-head historical records
- Implement season-long statistics
- Create visual charts and graphs

### Step 15: Additional Features
- Weekly leaderboards
- Season archives
- Trade tracking (if needed)
- Playoff bracket generation
- Mobile app API endpoints

## Key Considerations

### Performance
- Optimize database queries with indexes
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use batch operations for bulk updates
- Consider CDN for static assets

### Security
- Protect admin endpoints with authentication
- Validate all input data
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting on API calls

### Reliability
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement data backup strategies
- Create monitoring and alerting
- Plan for API outages

### Scalability
- Design for future league expansion
- Consider moving to PostgreSQL if needed
- Plan for historical data growth
- Implement data archiving strategy

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows
- Manual testing of admin functions
- Load testing for game-day traffic

## Deployment
- Choose hosting platform (Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc.)
- Set up continuous deployment
- Configure production environment
- Implement monitoring and logging
- Create backup and restore procedures

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for building the fantasy football app in manageable phases, ensuring each component is properly built before moving to the next.
