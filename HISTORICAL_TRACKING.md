# 2024 Season Tracking Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Data Foundation & NFL Roster Tracking

### 1. Enhance NFL Player Weekly Tracking
- Create `nfl_weekly_rosters` table to track which NFL team each player was on each week
- Sync NFL roster data for each week of 2024 season using Tank01 API
- Update player sync service to pull weekly NFL rosters

### 2. Verify 2024 Fantasy Roster Data

- Validate weekly_rosters table has complete 2024 season data (weeks 1-17)

## Phase 2: Matchup & Playoff System

### 3. Implement Matchup Generation
- Create matchup service to generate regular season matchups (weeks 1-12) from MATCHUPS.md
- Build playoff seeding algorithm based on division standings and points
- Generate playoff matchups for weeks 13-16 with proper bracket logic
- Handle week 17 as cumulative points week

### 4. Database Enhancements
- Add playoff_type field to matchups table ('regular', 'wildcard', 'divisional', 'championship', 'cumulative')
- Create playoff_seedings table to track final standings

## Phase 3: Scoring & Statistics

### 5. Weekly Scoring Engine

## Phase 4: Web Interface

### 7. Season Overview Dashboard

### 8. Game Detail Pages
- Individual matchup pages showing starting lineups and player performances
- Week-by-week breakdown of all matchups

### 9. Playoff Bracket Page
- Visual bracket showing playoff progression
- Final standings and point totals

## Key Technical Decisions

- Use existing `weekly_rosters.player_team` field to handle NFL roster changes
- Leverage Tank01 API for weekly NFL data synchronization
- Build on existing database schema with minimal modifications
- Create new web pages following existing HTML/CSS patterns

## Implementation Notes

### NFL Roster Tracking Solution
The system will handle NFL roster changes throughout the season using the existing `weekly_rosters` table structure. The `player_team` field in this table is already denormalized to capture which NFL team each player was on during each specific week, providing historical accuracy for scoring calculations.

### Matchup Schedule Reference
Matchups and playoff structure are defined in `MATCHUPS.md`:
- Regular season: Weeks 1-12
- Playoff structure: Weeks 13-16 with division-based seeding
- Week 17: Cumulative points competition

### Database Schema Extensions
Minimal changes required to existing schema:
- Add `nfl_weekly_rosters` table for NFL team tracking
- Extend `matchups` table with playoff_type field
- Create `playoff_seedings` table for final standings
